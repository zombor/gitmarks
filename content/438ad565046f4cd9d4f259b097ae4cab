      <div class="post-content"><p>Throughout the fall, I ran a series of posts on homemade gifts with enough lead time so that interested parties could make some of the gifts on their own if they so chose.  I wanted to top off the series by listing all of the items in the series, showing off the small mountain of stuff we made, and providing some pictures of some of the ways in which we packaged items.</p>
<p>Here are the homemade gift items we covered in the series:<br />

<p>That&#8217;s our collection of completed gifts.  A few of them (some of the beer and a few of the jars) had already been given as gifts when we took this picture.</p>
<p>As you can see, we made quite a bit of everything.  The handmade greeting cards are the one thing that&#8217;s not very visible here &#8211; they&#8217;re in the white boxes near the back of the picture, with white ribbon (which I&#8217;ll show again below).</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Beer and ornaments</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84335369@N00/5278225828/" title="Beer and some jars by trenttsd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5278225828_60480fe15e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Beer and some jars" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, we made custom labels for the beer, depicting me with a Santa hat drinking a pint.  We entitled the beer &#8220;Nit Wit,&#8221; mostly as a self-deprecating joke but also because the type of beer we made is a <em>wit</em>bier.</p>
<p>Since we were reconstituting six pack boxes for this, we simply took extra Nit Wit labels and affixed them to the side of the carriers.</p>
<p>Also, something worth noting with the homemade ornaments: we&#8217;re using a ribbon to attach them to some of the jam, jelly, soup, and brownie mix jars that we&#8217;re giving as gifts.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Vanilla and mailing</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84335369@N00/5277617495/" title="Soup and vanilla by trenttsd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5277617495_5c1ae87057.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Soup and vanilla" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We found some food-safe jars for the vanilla from an old friend who had extra jars from a food laboratory that were never going to get used.  They hold eight ounces of liquid with screw tops.</p>
<p>For them, we made up labels entitled &#8220;Super Joe&#8217;s Super Homemade Vanilla Extract&#8221; (referring to our oldest son&#8217;s superhero alter ego).  </p>
<p>A few of our gifts are traveling through the mail.  For those, we&#8217;re packing up the soup in Ziploc bags so that they&#8217;ll ship easily.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Handmade cards</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84335369@N00/5277619741/" title="Cards by trenttsd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5124/5277619741_7f57371f75.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Cards" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For the greeting cards, we wrapped each bundle (we made two bundles of 38 cards each) in tissue paper as you can see above, then sealed each bundle with a small snowflake sticker.</p>
<p>We then put these bundles into small garment boxes, closed the boxes, and wrapped some red ribbon around them, creating an understated look.</p>
<p>This was actually my favorite packaging of all of the gifts we made.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Soap</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/84335369@N00/5278232952/" title="Soap by trenttsd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5278232952_9760ece7a1.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Soap" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As we had a wide variety of soap sizes (including some &#8220;ball&#8221; soaps, which are something of a part of soapmaking tradition), we packaged them in different ways, as you can see above.  Three soap balls make a cute little snowman!</p>
<p>Around each soap bundle, we wrapped a small piece of paper entitled &#8220;Princess Katie&#8217;s Handmade Castille Soap&#8221; (after our daughter).</p>
<p>We actually ended up with a lot of these, so there are many people who are getting two or even three bars of this soap as a gift.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Final thoughts</span></strong><br />
My wife, Sarah, deserves a lot of credit for helping all of these gifts reach completion.  Some of the gifts were largely her project (like the scarves).  Others were almost entirely my project (like the greeting cards).  Others required both of our efforts (like the jams and jellies).</p>
<p>In any case, these gifts were made as a <em>team</em>, and without working together, we would have never been able to complete so many gifts.</p>

      <div class="post-content"><p><em>Throughout the month of December, The Simple Dollar is posting a daily series focusing on specific activities you can do right now to set the stage for a great 2011. Out with the old, in with the new.</em></p>
<p><strong>20. Prepare your will and your master information document.</strong></p>
<p>If you have no dependents, no descendents, and no one who would value having any of the items you possess, you can skip this one.  </p>
<p>If any of the above applies to you, though, pay attention.  The <em>worst</em> thing you can do to the people you care about is die suddenly with no sort of estate plan left behind and no indication of what and where all of your accounts are.  Not only is your family grieving, but they&#8217;re left to deal with confusion in figuring out where all of your accounts are, talking to a lawyer about intestacy, and hoping that a judge can resolve things reasonably.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want that, not if you care for those that you leave behind.  I&#8217;ve watched it happen before and, to put it simply, it&#8217;s a depressing mess.</p>
<p>The minimum I would suggest for anyone in terms of an estate plan is a will and a master information document.  Let&#8217;s address these in order.</p>
<p><strong><em>A will</em></strong>  A will is simply a document stating what you wish to happen to your property and assets should you pass away.  This usually handles everything for small estates; if you&#8217;re not a millionaire, a will should handle everything you need.</p>
<p>I do <em>not</em> recommend using a software program to prepare your final estate.  It&#8217;s a great tool for getting your ideas in order and ensuring that you have everything taken care of, but get your final will checked over by a lawyer who can make sure that it&#8217;s legally binding in your area.  I would also make sure that your executor, whoever you designate that to be, has a copy.</p>
<p>Get it done.  You won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p><strong><em>A master information document</em></strong>  Hand in hand with a will, in my opinion, is a master information document, something I <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/05/03/making-and-maintaining-a-master-information-document/">discussed in detail a while back</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, a master information document outlines all of your account information and other information someone would need to know about in the event of your passing.  Much of this information will be highly private, so you want to make sure that when you prepare such a document, you store it in a secure place and let only the most trusted people know where it is.</p>
<p>Having such a document can be incredibly valuable in the event of sudden death, as it makes it very easy for your survivors to close out accounts and so forth instead of having to hunt for information.  Rather than digging through mountains of statements, they can just simply refer to your document and have all of their concerns well in hand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other things to consider</em></strong>  While you&#8217;re at it, you may want to consider some other items.</p>
<p><em>An advance health care directive</em> states your wishes with regards to medical procedures intended to prolong your life in medical situations where you are incapable of making such a decision for yourself.  I have ceded all such choices to my wife, but many people may want to have control over such decisions.</p>
<p><em>A durable power of attorney</em> states who you wish to make legal decisions on your behalf if you are similarly incapacitated.</p>
<p>If you have a large estate, there are many other options to consider.  I would strongly encourage you, if you have a net worth in excess of one million dollars, to consult a lawyer with regards to estate planning.</p>
<p>In any case, <em>you owe it to the people you love</em> to take some time to get these pieces in place.  No one likes to think about their own mortality, but when you don&#8217;t think about it, you push that burden off onto the people you love at the very moment when they could really use your helping hand.</p>

<p>The longest night of the year in the northern hemisphere is tomorrow night.  After that, the nights begin to get shorter again, a pattern that continues until late June.</p>
<p>Where I live, this time of the year basically means that it&#8217;s barely light out when I wake up and dark again before I&#8217;m done with my typical day&#8217;s activities.  </p>
<p>I much prefer the long summer days.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="11220"></a>Q1: Joint expenses and loans</span><br />
My soon to be fiancé and I recently started living together. We live in a very expensive part of the country in a small apartment. He is currently in grad school. It is an expensive program, and he has some student loans to cover tuition and living expenses. We did Financial Peace University after he had accepted the loans. Neither of us have any consumer debt. We have budgeted so that he is spending way less than the loan money he has been given (about $4000 less each term, so about $12 K less each year of a two year program), and I am spending less than I earn as well. The extra money from his loans is sitting in his bank account, and he will use it to immediately start paying down the loans after graduation. I currently work full-time at a stable job, making about $46K. We currently split the expenses down the middle—me paying for my half with my paycheck, him paying for his half with his loan money. I am currently putting about $1000 into my savings each month. He has about 20K saved in his savings from before grad school, not including the student loan money. I have about $15K in my emergency fund and feel comfortable with that number. My questions: Would it be better for me to pay for all of our joint living expenses for the remainder of his degree, so that he can use less of his loan money, or is it more important that I continue to save that 1000 per month? What would be the best way for us to jointly manage our money and the loans? For whatever reason, it seems like a really confusing decision for us. </strong><br />
- Samantha</p>
<p>You&#8217;re moving from a situation where you have separate finances to a situation where your finances are essentially joined together.  In that event, you should be choosing whatever path results in the best overall financial picture for the two of you.</p>
<p>If your fiance is taking out extra loans solely to pay for the rent, that&#8217;s not a great long-term financial move, particularly if you have an emergency fund large enough to cover a few months&#8217; worth of living expenses.  Assuming the two of you are really in this for the long haul, the smartest move would be for you to cover most or perhaps all of the rent, minimizing his loans.</p>
<p>Before you make that move, though, be absolutely sure that the two of you are in this for the long haul.  If you continue to date until he has his degree and then you break it off, you essentially just paid for part of the college degree of your ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="21220"></a>Q2: Buying a house right now</span><br />
We live in the Washington, DC area and are considering buying a house.  We plan to stay in the area for at least the next 5 years, though there may be a 1-year break for me to go to grad school (we&#8217;d rent out our place).  If it worked financially, we&#8217;d consider keeping this property as a rental even after moving out of the area.</p>
<p>Despite the planned break for grad school and thoughts of moving in 5 years, we&#8217;re starting to seriously consider buying in the area.  Our apartment rent is set to increase substantially in the next two months, interest rates are very low, house prices have dropped (they&#8217;re still expensive, but as reasonable as I&#8217;ve seen in the DC area), and we think housing in this area can only stand to appreciate over the longer term.  A house in the area we&#8217;re focused on &#8211; for reasons of great schools, good potential resale value, and reasonable commute &#8211; will set us back $350,000-400,000.  We have cash for a down payment of ~15-18%.  Our expected mortgage payment would be less than our monthly rent, though we know there are a lot more costs that come with home ownership.</p>
<p>My biggest hesitation is making a financial decision like this when we have significant student loans to pay back.  Unfortunately, my husband racked up a lot of student debt between undergrad and grad schools &#8211; it&#8217;s around $200,000, mostly at 4-5% interest rates with some smaller amounts at higher rates (8%).  We know we have to pay this back, and we are.  We currently pay around $1,000/month toward the student debt; as our income rises, we may have to pay up to $2,000/month.  Our only other debt is a car payment ($150/month).  We bring home about $6,500-7,000/month after taxes, insurance premiums, and 401k savings. </p>
<p>Given the student debt we have left to pay off, is it a stupid idea to buy a house? </p>
<p>As a follow up question, should we be focused more on paying off the student loans than on funding retirement plans?</strong><br />
- Tori</p>
<p>With that big of a student loan over your head, your housing option should be the one that costs you the least amount, whatever that may be.  I think you need to sit down and investigate the complete cost of home ownership for the home you&#8217;re considering.</p>
<p>How much will insurance be?  How about homeowner&#8217;s association fees?  Property taxes?  These are three areas that you can get an estimate for right now &#8211; and I&#8217;m almost sure you&#8217;ll find that the cost, even with these categories, goes way up from what you&#8217;re spending right now.</p>
<p>If you can find an option that costs you <em>less</em> than what you&#8217;re spending right now, go for it.</p>
<p>As for your retirement plan versus your student loans, I would make sure that you&#8217;re socking away 10% of your income towards retirement.  Anything beyond that should be going towards the loans.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="31220"></a>Q3: Keepsake distribution</span><br />
My mother is going to be entering a retirement home after the Christmas season.  She will be selling her home and some of the possessions in it.  This will be our last Christmas at the old house.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s told me, my siblings, and all of her grandchildren that she&#8217;s going to be distributing all of the family keepsakes and personal items in the house this Christmas.  We don&#8217;t know how she&#8217;s going to go about it and some of us are a bit concerned that there will be fighting over a few key items.  Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this in advance so that our last Christmas there isn&#8217;t ruined?</strong><br />
- Millie</p>
<p>I would suggest that your mother decide before you all arrive what items she&#8217;s intending to distribute to whom.  Let it be entirely her decision &#8211; after all, it is her things.</p>
<p>If there are items people want that aren&#8217;t claimed, I would suggest having a drawing to determine an order of people.  The first person in that drawing gets to claim an heirloom of their choice, followed by the next person and so on.</p>
<p>All of you love your mother and her home and all of you will want an item to remember things by.  Keep that in mind and it&#8217;ll go smoother.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="41220"></a>Q4: Savings or student loans?</span><br />
My fiancee and I are both 23 and living separately at our parents&#8217; houses. As such, the only expenses we really have are student loans and car payments. She makes less than I do, and has about the same in student loans, with a smaller monthly car payment. In the past year, because I&#8217;ve had little other expenses, I&#8217;ve been putting as much as I can on the student loans as possible, to the tune of $12,000, or $1000 a month, which is well above the minimum payment. Also, I&#8217;ve been putting 8% of my paycheck to my 401(k), which is a little more than the company matches. Again, I&#8217;m taking advantage of the fact I have few other expenses now, so I&#8217;m doing as much as I can in other areas. My fiancee and I opened a joint savings account together, which grows $600 per month, and we&#8217;ve got about $3500 in there. It&#8217;s our wedding/house starter money.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m paying off loans so quickly, I really haven&#8217;t saved much, personally, in about a year. I still have about $12,000 in savings, and my fiancee has about $8,000.</p>
<p>My question was this: should I keep paying off the student loans at $1000 per month, or should I slow it down a bit and ramp up my savings? Also, one of my savings accounts (about $6000) has been sitting around, doing nothing but earning minimal interest. I was thinking about either Treasury notes (which ties up the money for a year) or a shorter CD (higher interest than my regular savings, but with the ability to get to the money after a shorter time). My fiancee doesn&#8217;t really like the idea of either, because she thinks we&#8217;ll need that money VERY shortly, when we haven&#8217;t really looked at houses or anything.</strong><br />
- Josh</p>
<p>This is a moot question if you and your fiancee aren&#8217;t on the same page about what your financial future holds.  The first thing you need to do is sit down together and talk about where you two intend to be in a year, in five years, and so on.  Without knowing that &#8211; and knowing when you intend to buy a home together, get married, and so forth &#8211; you can&#8217;t plan appropriately with your money.</p>
<p>If your home ownership is more than two years or so away, I&#8217;d probably spend 2011 knocking off those student loans.  Being debt free is something you&#8217;ll never regret, plus it&#8217;ll give you the freedom to start saving in earnest for whatever may come.</p>
<p>If your wife-to-be is seriously thinking of buying a home in the next few months, then make minimal student loan payments and save every drop of cash that you can.  You&#8217;ll need it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="51220"></a>Q5: Homebuyer&#8217;s tax credit repayment</span><br />
My husband (fiance at the time) bought a house in March 2009 for 160,000 and qualified for the 8,000 home tax credit. It had been his dream to remodel an older home and so for the past year and a half, we have completely replaced and updated everything. Unfortunately, although we love our house, we have really grown to dislike the neighborhood (broken into once and have had several items stolen from the sheds, yard, etc) and are looking to move to a nicer neighborhood. Anyway, we have probably put $40,000 into the renovations and since we will be selling (hopefully!) before having lived in the house for 36 months, we will have to pay back that 8,000. However, IRS form 5405 states that we would not have to pay back the credit if we do not have a &#8220;gain on the sale (as figured after reducing the basis of my home by the credit I claimed in 2008)&#8221;. We are hoping to sell our house for 190,000 and so, would be losing money with all the renovations. We still have our receipts and everything. My question is, do we have to pay back the tax credit? </strong><br />
- Emily</p>
<p>I consulted a tax professional friend of mine and he stated that he believed you would have to pay back the credit.</p>
<p>In his words, &#8220;the rule is written to prevent exactly what they did which is increase their home value through renovation then flip it quickly.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If you sell it within the 36 month time period, expect to pay back the credit.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="61220"></a>Q6: Emergency fund size</span><br />
We have a $65K emergency fund, which represents about 9 months of expenses.  We also own a rental property that is completely paid for. Our only debt is a truck payment of $394 a month (0% interest; 3 years left on the loan). Since we have the emergency fund in placed, I have been paying $1K extra a month on our mortgage principal. As I read your blog, especially about the readers who are struggling financially to cover basic necessities, I&#8217;ve become a little paranoid and I&#8217;m now wondering if we should stop paying so much money on the principal and add more to the emergency fund. I&#8217;m a teacher and my husband is a school bus driver. Our combined monthly net income is about $7k, from September through June and this amount does not include the income we make our rental property, which is about $1,500 when both apartments are rented.  We pay about $5K every five months for our son&#8217;s college tuition. He opted for a community college and will be attending a public university nearby to save on room and board.  What&#8217;s your take? Should we put more money in the emergency fund and reduce the amount paid on the loan pricipal? </strong><br />
- Deborah</p>
<p>I would make sure that you have enough in your emergency fund to cover at least three months&#8217; worth of all of your expenses.  The cash total in your account should cover every bill that you would expect to come your way over a three month period &#8211; mortgage payments, utilities, taxes, food, car payments, and so on.  I would encourage you to perhaps even have four or five months&#8217; worth.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what that number is &#8211; you&#8217;ll have to calculate it yourself.  However, I think your emergency fund is probably large enough in this case.</p>
<p>However, if you do feel uncomfortable with the size of your emergency fund, it does not harm anything to increase the size of it.  </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="71220"></a>Q7: Investing baby steps</span><br />
I&#8217;m a young student (around 20) and I&#8217;m starting to invest my hard earned income. I&#8217;m lucky to live in my parents&#8217; house, so I don&#8217;t have rent or grocery to pay. Therefore, I think the timming is right to start. What book would you recommend me to read to get a better knowledge of investment (read here placement, investment fund, bond, etc.)?</strong><br />
- Gabriel</p>
<p>For starters, you need to set a goal, and I&#8217;m going to speculate that one of those goals is to move out from your parents&#8217; house.</p>
<p>If you have enough extra money that you&#8217;re starting to sock it away in &#8220;investments,&#8221; you need to be looking at a timeline for your independence from them.  </p>
<p>My suggestion is to sit down with them and have a face-to-face talk about what the expectations are and what the plan is for you becoming fully independent.  That will help you to figure out what exactly you should be saving for.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="81220"></a>Q8: Underwater questions</span><br />
Two and a half years ago, my husband and I purchased a house.  The market in our area was just beginning to show signs of faltering, but we got a house we love for an affordable monthly payment.  At the time we only put down 8%, got a 30 year mortgage at 6% and do not pay PMI (our credit union does not charge PMI on any mortgage it issues).  With the interest rates being so low now, I was considering attempting a refinance.  However, looking at the recent home sales in the neighborhood, there is a good chance that our house will appraise at or below the amount we owe on it.  So onto my questions. </p>
<p>If our house appraises for less than we owe on it, are there repercussions?  I&#8217;m guessing it means refinancing goes out the window, but can it effect our existing mortgage?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say our house appraises better than we hope.  My understanding of PMI is that it is effectively an higher interest rate for the years of payments before you have paid off 20% of your home&#8217;s value.  Is it worth it to move to a loan with PMI if the PMI plus the interest paid is less than the interest we&#8217;re paying now?  Is PMI tax deductible like mortgage interest is?</strong><br />
- Margot</p>
<p>If your home appraises for less than you owe on it, it means you&#8217;re underwater.  It doesn&#8217;t directly change a thing about your mortgage agreement.</p>
<p>The problem is that it will be very difficult to move your mortgage elsewhere, as a home mortgage relies on having an asset behind it that&#8217;s worth at least somewhat more than the amount loaned out.  They&#8217;re not going to loan you more money than your home is worth.</p>
<p>If your home is appraised for more than the mortgage, then you may be able to move it elsewhere.  There will be different kinds of offers on the table, some with PMI and some without (but with higher interest rates).  I wouldn&#8217;t move it unless you get one that reduces your interest rate by more than 1% and has a combined interest plus PMI rate that&#8217;s lower than your current rate.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="91220"></a>Q9: Saving priority before moving</span><br />
I try to be very diligent about saving. Every month I automatically contribute to the follow accounts</p>
<p>Roth IRA (going to max out for the year)<br />
401K (small ammount because my employer doesn&#8217;t match)<br />
An index fund ($300 per month with the intention of this account being a down payment for a house 10 years from now)<br />
$150 a month to a savings account for long term goals<br />
$100 a month for emergency fund<br />
A variable amount for other savings accounts (Christmas gifts, vacation, engagement ring)</p>
<p>I live with my girlfriend in San Francisco and I intend to marry her in a few years. She is applying to graduate school in New York. If she gets in I intend to move with her. My question is should I save less in the index fund for the house deposit and instead start putting more money into the more accessible savings account so I can use the money if I need to for a move?</p>
<p>My company has an office in New York and would likely provide me with some sort of stipend for moving.</strong><br />
- Joe</p>
<p>Whenever you move, it&#8217;s always a great idea to have some liquidity.  If you think that a move is coming up soon, I would start buffing up your cash savings.</p>
<p>Why?  Every move I&#8217;ve ever seen involves tons of little expenses, from restocking a household to utility deposits.  There will be a healthy outpouring of cash during that timeframe and if it&#8217;s in the near future, you need to have the cash to cover it.</p>
<p>Your index fund can wait &#8211; it&#8217;s long term anyway.  Prepare for this short term spending situation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;"><a name="101220"></a>Q10: Savings rates and journeys</span><br />
I started reading the archives of your blog, and came to the realization that we are in a similar situation as you were when you started the blog &#8211; credit card debt, student loans, a decent household income, auto loans, a little savings, bought a house a year ago, first child on the way.  We have tried to start paying down debt aggresively in the past, but something always derailed us (saving cash for a down payment for our house, travel, a job loss).  We are now in what I feel is a great position to start paying down debt and to get our financial lives started in the right direction.</p>
<p>My question is in two unrelated parts.  First, going back to the beginning of your journey in your archives, you made mention in many of your posts about placing your savings, and/or your emergency fund, in a high-yield savings account, with rates in the 4-5% range.  You wrote this stuff 3-4 years ago, however, and those type of rates for savings accounts don&#8217;t exist anymore.  The best I can seem to find is in the 1.3% range.  Do you have any recommendations of higher-yield savings accounts, or other savings options with similar liquidity and a higher rate?  Our emergency fund is currently in a savings account earning 0.05% APY, which is a joke (we earned four cents on $1000 last month).</p>
<p>My second question is more about the financial journey.  I really enjoy reading your blog, others like it, and have previously read a few of the books you&#8217;ve reviewed in the past.  I&#8217;m constantly looking for ways to save money, create more income, and seeing when certain debts will disappear.  My problem is that I just can&#8217;t wait for these things to happen.  I&#8217;m confident enough in my job, my wife&#8217;s job, and our plan, that I can see the day when we&#8217;re debt free (except for our mortgage and some very low-interest student loans) and can begin expanding our emergency fund to cover 6 months of expenses, and then begin investing.  The problem is, I want to see it now.  For some reason, I&#8217;m becoming somewhat obsessive over this (I happen to enjoy the subject, the reading, and the numbers), and just can&#8217;t wait for these plans to become a reality.  It&#8217;s not adversely affecting my life, or relationship, or anything like that, but I always seem to be running numbers in my head.  Maybe I&#8217;m being perfectly normal about it, but any advice on patience?  I know this is supposed to take years.  I just can&#8217;t stand to wait that long&#8230;</strong><br />
- Kevin</p>
<p>Those rates existed in 2007.  Thanks to the economic conditions since then and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s response to them, these rates have dropped through the floor.  The best you&#8217;re going to find that isn&#8217;t some sort of teaser or isn&#8217;t combined with some sort of restrictions is probably in that 1.3% range right now.</p>
<p>As for having patience when it comes to watching your financial progress, my suggestion is to calculate your net worth very, very frequently and chart it in comparison to your previous calculation.  Do it each and every pay period.</p>
<p>There was a time in my own financial journey where I felt very frustrated by the slow progress.  An intense focus on my net worth, particularly in terms of comparing it to my previous net worth, helped me get through it and really understand how my little steps were becoming bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>

      <div class="post-content"><p><em>Every Sunday, The Simple Dollar reviews a personal finance book or other book of interest.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470579757?tag=onejourney-20"><img src="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/financiallystupid.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" border="0" alt="fspae" /></a>The title of this book convinced me to pick it up at the library recently, but it was the introduction that caused me to actually take it home and give it a full read.</p>
<p>The introduction, entitled &#8220;Life as a Sucker,&#8221; makes the case that society is stacked against individual financial success unless you already have a lot of capital.  Almost every element of modern society and government works <em>against</em> you without a large bankroll in your hand with which to generate more money.</p>
<p>In some ways, I agree with him.  The path to personal finance success is not an easy one.  I receive far more notes from people in financially disastrous situations than I can ever possibly address in my reader mailbags.  There are, of course, reasons for that phenomenon, many of which the author, Jason Kelly, addresses in this book.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>1: The First Rule of Finance</strong></span><br />
Live within your means by spending no more than 80% of your take-home pay.  That&#8217;s the first rule of personal finance and I absolutely agree with it.  If you can commit to doing that on average, you&#8217;re going to find yourself building up a lot of money in your savings over time, money that will keep financial disasters (like a job loss) at bay and make moves like buying your own home or buying a replacment car much, much easier.  A big key, though, is to <em>bank</em> on that money, meaning that if you take money out of your savings, make extra payments beyond that 20% to restore what you took out.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>2: Credit, Cars, and Castles</strong></span><br />
Kelly identifies these three elements as the most devastating opponents of personal finance success.  Your credit cards (and the availability of easy consumer credit, your automobiles, and your home &#8211; together, they eat up a <em>lot</em> of your monthly resources if you&#8217;re paying off all of these loans.  If you&#8217;re taking out a big debt for a home or an automobile that goes beyond what you minimally need, you&#8217;re essentially locking down your finances each month for the sake of having something beyond what you actually need.  You&#8217;re chaining yourself to your job and walking a tightrope because you wanted more stuff.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>3: Toxic FSP in the Alphabet Industry</strong></span><br />
The housing bubble only happened because people forgot the first rule of personal finance and allowed themselves to live beyond their means.  When lots of people start doing this, you&#8217;ll eventually see a financial bubble of some sort, and when the people with a lot of money decide that the bubble is going to burst, they move their money and lo and behold, the bubble bursts.  Prices revert to the mean and people who bought in during the bubble are left holding the bag.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>4: The Society You&#8217;re Up Against</strong></span><br />
Society in general encourages overspending.  It lauds having the latest consumer goods, encourages people to buy the latest and greatest things, and idolizes people who have great material wealth while encouraging others to emulate them.  The end result of this, of course, is widespread financial hardship as people use their limited means to chase an affluent lifestyle that they think they deserve.  The only people that win in this equation are the people who own the companies manufacturing all the stuff.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>5: Government of the Corporations, by the Corporations, for the Corporations</strong></span><br />
The laws of the United States protect corporations by giving them most of the rights of people but few of the restrictions of people.  For example, if a company is neglectful or abusive of someone, they are only penalized a small cash amount &#8211; you can&#8217;t send a corporation to prison.  Thus, corporations push the boundaries of what would be legal or ethical behavior for an individual person because there is minimal penalty for them to act in that way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>6: How Money Is Power</strong></span><br />
Money is power because it both influences the laws of the land and also influences the methods people have of getting information.  The more money you have, the better access to information that you have and the better decisions you&#8217;re able to make.  In short, if you don&#8217;t have money in the bank, the deck of society is stacked against you.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>7: Financial Freedom</strong></span><br />
This brings us back full circle to the idea that freedom is bought by having control over your finances.  Kelly makes the point that of the money we earn, roughly a third goes to government, another third goes towards maintaining what we need, and the other third goes towards maintaining what we want.  The problem, of course, is that people are clever at extracting money from that third that defines what we want, either by convincing us that it&#8217;s a need or justifying the want.  The path to financial freedom is understanding that &#8220;want&#8221; section: knowing what is and isn&#8217;t a need and having control over the things you want.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>8: Guarantee Your Own Well-Being</strong></span><br />
The best thing you can possibly do for your future is simply to gain control over your wants and put some of that want money to good use.  Money in the bank is the best guarantee we have for present and future well-being that isn&#8217;t reliant on banks or government or any other entity to hold us up.  If you want to succeed no matter what the future holds, you have to be self-reliant.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>9: On the Front Lines of Freedom</strong></span><br />
Kelly closes the book by offering a few examples of real lives: people who are fighting this battle for themselves, getting control over their wants and their finances for a long-term healthy future.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>Is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470579757?tag=onejourney-20">Financially Stupid People Are Everywhere</a></em> Worth Reading?</strong></span><br />
I really enjoyed this book simply because it stands out distinctly from the pack of personal finance books out there.  It says some distinct, interesting, and thought provoking things about the causes of individual financial malaise and offers some unique angles about how to escape that malaise.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470579757?tag=onejourney-20">Financially Stupid People Are Everywhere</a></em> has more of a political tinge to it than most of the books I review &#8211; it&#8217;s an integral part of the book, one you&#8217;ll figure out within fifteen seconds of reading the introduction.  Because of that nature and because Kelly keeps that focus throughout, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470579757?tag=onejourney-20">Financially Stupid People Are Everywhere</a></em> becomes a pretty compelling and thoughtful read.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t purely agree with everything Kelly says in the book, but I do think there are a lot of worthwhile ideas in here to consider, and that makes <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470579757?tag=onejourney-20">Financially Stupid People Are Everywhere</a></em> a worthwhile read.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll mention one of my own, because it relates to a woman I&#8217;ve attempted to locate several times since college with no success.  Her name was Nicole and we became very, very close friends for a few years in college.  After going through some personal trauma, she abruptly left the country on a missionary trip and, after that, I scarcely saw her again.  We invited her to our wedding and, without an address, we used that of her parents.  She sent back a polite note declining our invitation and, since then, I&#8217;ve been completely unable to reach her in any way.</p>
<p>I can think of several others as well.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time, I can think of relationships I <em>have</em> re-established over the years.  I&#8217;ve picked up the thread with several old friends and professional acquaintances over the years by doing nothing more than reaching out, and it&#8217;s been one of the best things I&#8217;ve done, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for doing it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Just &#8220;friending&#8221; someone on Facebook doesn&#8217;t cut the mustard.</strong>  Facebook is useful for keeping tabs on existing friends, but you don&#8217;t &#8220;click&#8221; with someone just by clicking the &#8220;Add as friend&#8221; button.  You can <em>use</em> Facebook to do it, but just friending and lurking isn&#8217;t really much of a connection at all.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to go is to compose a twofold message.</strong>  What do I mean by that?  Simply put, you compose a message to them that contains both a brief update on what you&#8217;ve been doing along with <em>specific questions</em> about how they&#8217;re doing.  </p>
<p>Put yourself in their shoes.  Someone who hasn&#8217;t been a part of their life for a long while suddenly pops out of the blue with an email talking about themselves.  How exactly do you follow up on that?  I wouldn&#8217;t know how, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>you make it easy on the recipient.</em>  Ask them some questions that makes it easy to talk about what they&#8217;ve been up to.  Put the ball in their court.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re re-establishing contact just to tell someone off again, don&#8217;t bother.</strong>  It doesn&#8217;t help anyone if you&#8217;re still grinding your axe over something that happened years ago and you&#8217;re just waiting to swing that axe and feel righteous about how you were mistreated a decade or so ago.  Don&#8217;t waste your time.</p>
<p><strong>Look for ways to help the person out if you&#8217;re reconnecting.</strong>  There are lots of ways you can help people.  If they&#8217;re looking for work and you know someone in their field, ask them for their resume and pass it on to the person you know.  </p>
<p><strong>Keep the communication going.</strong>  Once you&#8217;ve found out what&#8217;s going on with them, touch base every month or so.  Ask them what&#8217;s new and let them know what&#8217;s new with you.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for little things.</strong>  One of the best ways to cement a connection is to create a give-and-take of small exchanges.  For example, if you&#8217;re going to be traveling to an area they know well, ask the person for restaurant recommendations.  Offer to meet them for lunch if you&#8217;re going to be in their area.  Little steps like this take only a moment of your time, but help establish a bond that will be valuable for years to come.</p>
<p>Getting back in touch with old friends and coworkers is almost always something that I&#8217;m extremely glad I&#8217;ve done, and more than once, it&#8217;s paid incredible dividends in my life.  It only takes a few minutes to open that door.</p>

      <div class="post-content"><p><em>Throughout the month of December, The Simple Dollar is posting a daily series focusing on specific activities you can do right now to set the stage for a great 2011. Out with the old, in with the new.</em></p>
<p><strong>18. Develop a robust filing system.</strong></p>
<p>A few years ago, I had a nightmarish time filing my taxes.  I still remember it &#8211; 2007 was &#8220;the year of the dreaded tax return.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem wasn&#8217;t filling out the forms or anything like that.  The problem was simply finding all of the papers I needed to get the taxes finished.  Some papers were in the &#8220;catch all&#8221; on the entryway table.  Some were stowed away in various drawers.  Still others were in a box of &#8220;important papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a mess.  I spent many hours going through piles of papers.  Finally, after the whole process was over, I realized how worthwhile it would have been to spend thirty minutes spread throughout the year getting and keeping all of this stuff in order.</p>
<p>I spent some time reading about home filing systems, purchased a filing cabinet and some folders, and never looked back.</p>
<p>It seemed, at the time, as though the process of setting it up would take forever and never really repay the time investment, but after a few years of having it, I have to say that time and time again, a good paper filing system has saved me a substantial amount of time on the whole.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 120%;">Starting from Scratch</span></strong><br />
Many people who start a filing system in their home are starting from nothing more than a big pile of disorganized &#8220;important&#8221; papers.  </p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/15/a-fresh-start-how-to-organize-all-of-your-financial-documents-in-a-filing-cabinet/">detailed guide</a> on filing from scratch a few years ago, but I&#8217;ll summarize it for you below.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you need a good place to store your files &#8211; a filing cabinet.  I&#8217;d look for four things when shopping: </p>
<p><strong>A good suspension system</strong>  Do the drawers slide in and out easily?<br />
<strong>Counterbalancing</strong>  If you pull out a full drawer, does it cause the cabinet to tip?<br />
<strong>Thick and rust-resistant metal, possibly lockable</strong>  Does the metal in the cabinet seem flimsy?  Is it stainless steel?<br />
<strong>Look for the Underwriters’ Laboratory seal</strong>  This is usually a great indication of a quality filing cabinet.</p>
<p>What exactly do you file?  I think this depends heavily on the person, but here are the documents that I include:</p>
<p>Personal papers<br />
Tax returns<br />
Deeds, titles, and surveys<br />
Insurance policies<br />
Household inventory<br />
Instruction manuals and warranties<br />
Hard drive backups<br />
Paycheck stubs<br />
Employee benefit statements and plans<br />
Retirement statements and plans<br />
Credit card statements<br />
Debt documentation<br />
Investment information<br />
Charitable donation receipts<br />
A will<br />
Trust documentation<br />
A durable power of attorney<br />
A living will<br />
A master document explaining what all of this stuff is</p>
<p>Some of these documents also exist in a second copy in a safe deposit box at a local bank, in case of a devastating home fire.</p>
<p>Trust me: it&#8217;s well worth your time to get a robust filing system in place.  You&#8217;ll find yourself turning to it &#8211; and valuing it &#8211; time and time again over the coming years.</p>

      <div class="post-content"><p>Many newer readers of The Simple Dollar haven’t been exposed to the hundreds of great articles in the archives of the site, so this is a weekly series that highlights the five best posts from one year ago this week, two years ago this week, and three years ago this week.

      <div class="post-content"><p><em>Throughout the month of December, The Simple Dollar is posting a daily series focusing on specific activities you can do right now to set the stage for a great 2011. Out with the old, in with the new.</em></p>
<p><strong>17. Clean out your pantry and restock it.</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest money savers I&#8217;ve ever found is simply cooking at home.  There was a time in my early adult life where I ate out for almost every meal.  I&#8217;d eat out for breakfast, picking up a bagel and some coffee.  I&#8217;d eat out for lunch with coworkers.  I&#8217;d eat out for dinner with my wife or, sometimes, with friends.  I <em>rarely</em> ate at home.</p>
<p>Over time, though, I slowly started moving towards making my own meals.  At first, it wasn&#8217;t because of a financial benefit &#8211; it was simply due to a growing interest in food preparation, brought on by reading food magazines and the like.</p>
<p>It took some time to get skilled enough that I felt ready to prepare meals off the cuff in my kitchen.  Early on, I burned everything and didn&#8217;t understand the need for slower cooking, but as I improved, I found myself making all kinds of things, from <em>coq au vin</em> to from-scratch lasagna (including the noodles).  </p>
<p>What I discovered along the way is that <strong>the more conducive your cupboard contents are to cooking things from scratch at home, the easier it becomes and the more likely you are to do it.</strong>  If all you have in the cupboard is random prepackaged foods that, frankly, don&#8217;t taste all that good or only <em>some</em> of the stuff you need to make things at home, then you&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s much harder to convince yourself to just go home and throw something together for dinner.</p>
<p>So, how do you get from typical cupboards to this?</p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>clean out your cupboards and take stock of what you have.</strong>  Pull <em>everything</em> out.  Cover your floors and tables with boxes and bags and containers.  Group them in whatever ways make sense to you.</p>
<p>As you go, <strong>throw out the outdated stuff.</strong>  Trust me, you have stuff that&#8217;s old in your cupboards.  Spices that have sat in there for more than a year.  Canned and boxed foods past their expiration date.  Flour that seems to have some sort of infestation.  Get rid of all of it now.</p>
<p>Once you have all of this stuff out there, <strong>commit to eating some of the boxed foods and <em>give away the rest</em>.</strong>  Yep, take it down to the food pantry and give it away if you have an abundance of it.  Pass it on to someone who can actually use it before the expiration date.</p>
<p>For most people, this will eliminate a <em>lot</em> of the contents of their cupboards &#8211; a shocking amount, even.  What you&#8217;re left with, though, are usable staples and just a small handful of prepackaged foods.</p>
<p>Now you can stock your pantry and cupboards with real ingredients, the types of things that make it possible for you to toss together meals of a wide variety quite easily.  Here&#8217;s a great suggested pantry list from <a href="http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/pantry.htm">The Reluctant Gourmet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>    * Anchovies: a must for many pasta sauces, flat filets in a can or anchovy paste.<br />
    * Artichokes: canned hearts packed in water.<br />
    * Beans: an assortment of canned (easier) or dry (more work but tastier). Bread crumbs<br />
    * Capers: great in salads and pasta dishes.<br />
    * Chutney: great for crackers and sauces.<br />
    * Clam juice: a good substitute for fish stock.<br />
    * Corn meal: great for dredging foods and a must for polenta.<br />
    * Coconut: either shredded in a can or coconut milk or better yet, both.Cornstarch: for thickening sauces<br />
    * Crackers: assorted types.<br />
    * Dried fruits: apples, apricots, currants, figs, and raisins.<br />
    * Dried herbs: basil, bay leaves, chili powder, cinnamon, dill, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, crushed red pepper, rosemary, sage, tarragon, thyme.<br />
    * Extracts: vanilla is the most important, but try orange and almond.<br />
    * Flour: unbleached all-purpose<br />
    * Jams, Jellies, Preserves, and Honey<br />
    * Ketchup: always have an extra bottle on hand.<br />
    * Mushrooms: an assortment of dried including shiitake, morels, and porcini.<br />
    * Mustard: Dried and Dijon in a jar<br />
    * Oils: Olive, pure for everyday cooking and virgin for drizzling, canola, and sesame.<br />
    * Olives: canned, pitted and non-pitted, nicoise and calamata and olive paste<br />
    * Pasta: an assortment of shapes and sizes; dried<br />
    * Peanut butter: I like the chunky style.<br />
    * Peas: canned petite style. Fresh is better, but these are good to have on hand<br />
    * Pepper: whole peppercorns, ground black and white pepper.<br />
    * Pesto, Tapenade, Salsa<br />
    * Rice: Arborio (for risotto), brown, white, wild (not really a rice but a long grain marsh grass).<br />
    * Salt: regular and sea salt.<br />
    * Salad Dressings: my favorite is Good Seasons<br />
    * Sauces: Soy or Tamari, Tabasco, Teriyaki, and Worcestershire<br />
    * Sugar: white and brown, granulated and confectioners<br />
    * Tomatoes: canned &#8211; whole plum, paste, and puree; sun-driedTuna: canned, packed in water.<br />
    * Vinegar: balsamic, white wine, red wine, rice wine.Wines: Marsala, Madeira, and Sherry</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have all of this in your pantry, you&#8217;re in great shape for some wonderful cooking in your future.  This list provides everything you need to make anything from simple spaghetti to very complex dishes.  </p>
<p>Even better, you&#8217;ll quickly find that, if you have any initiative to cook at all, having an organized pantry entices you to prepare more food at home.  Preparing more food at home means that your food bill each month goes down.  That means you find yourself more in control of your financial life than ever.</p>
