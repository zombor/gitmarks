			<p>
				<p>A number of people have asked about upgrading iPod hard drives &#8212; what to buy, how to prepare, and how to perform the upgrade &#8212; so here are all the technical details.  If you&#8217;ve never worked inside an iPod before, this is certainly an advanced tutorial, but don&#8217;t let that scare you.  Working slowly and methodically, you too can upgrade your iPod and store even more music, photos, and videos.</p>
<p><b>What to Buy</b><br />
<img src="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/ipod_drive.jpg" align="right" class="right" />Which hard drive to buy depends on your specific iPod model, so like any half-decent attempt at an upgrade, a little research will go a long way towards making a good purchase.  The main factors that will affect your decision are the height, or thickness, of both the iPod and hard drive, and the connector style employed by both.  Since day one of the iPod launch, Toshiba has produced all the hard drives employed in the full size iPod lineup.  While they enjoyed a profitable OEM business arrangement with Apple, the drives are in no way exclusive to the iPod, and they can be found in many other products, including (not surprisingly) some Toshiba laptops and (perhaps more surprisingly) Microsoft&#8217;s Zune player.  To allow for some flexibility in product lineups, Toshiba&#8217;s 1.8&#8243; hard drives come in two thicknesses &#8212; the thinner has one physical storage platter inside, and the thicker has two.  Doubling-up of the storage surfaces is why you&#8217;ll often see a given capacity drive, and the next step up of two times that capacity.  As technology advances, the capacity of each surface increases while the dimensions remain fixed for easy interchange-ability.  This is good news for iPod upgraders.  The longer you wait, the more you can store in the same amount of space.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s iPods are fairly easy to find a matching replacement/upgrade hard drive for, as you can generally tell which thickness drive you need just by comparing it to the others of its family.  If your iPod was the thicker of the series when you purchased it, it takes the thicker, two-platter hard drive (examples include the then-higher capacity models such as 40 GB iPod and 60 GB iPod photo).  The thinner models (like the 15 GB iPod and 30 GB iPod photo) take the thinner hard drives.</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/video-ipod.ars/6"><img src="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/zif_drive.jpg" align="right" class="right" border="0" /></a>The 5th generation iPods with video capability are a different beast, as the drive technology and space requirements have demanded smaller internals.  With that in mind, Toshiba engineered a new connector on recent drives that is vastly smaller than the previous models.  These new drives sport a Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) connector, which, unlike the older iPods, requires no pressure to connect the cable.  Simply holding the hair-thin ribbon cable in place and folding down a clamp-like lock will secure all 40 pins in a staggeringly small, fragile connector.  The connector on the 5G iPods&#8217; logic boards is now no wider than your thumbnail, and it, too is quite delicate.  Such is the way of ever-shrinking consumer electronics.</p>
<p><b>Tools of the Trade</b><br />
Before you decide on a hard drive, you&#8217;ll also want to purchase a few tools to ensure the job gets done right.  While you&#8217;re able to pry most iPods apart using a tool as simple as a butter knife, the professionals use the following to make entry, upgrade, and close-up as invisible as possible.</p>
<ul style="margin: none; padding: none;">
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><b><a href="http://www.command-tab.com/2005/11/17/apples-black-stick/">Apple&#8217;s &#8220;black stick&#8221;</a></b><br />This nylon-based pry tool is key to almost any iPod upgrade, as it provides a strong lever to get into the edges of the case, while its plastic properties leave next to no marks or chewed-up looking spots along the edges.  Best bought from <a href="http://www.stanleysupplyservices.com/product-group.aspx?id=10980">Stanley Supply &#038; Services</a>.<img src="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/black_stick.jpg" /></li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><b>IC puller or hemostats (both available at your local RadioShack)</b><br />Either of these tools will work for undoing the iPod battery cable and handling some of the smaller pieces of the iPod.  Not necessary, but highly recommended if you plan on doing more than one upgrade.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><b>A straight razor blade (for 5G iPods)</b><br /><img src="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/razor.jpg" align="right" />I was hesitant to include this, as it&#8217;s a recipe for injury if you&#8217;re not careful.  In the interest of completeness, though, it&#8217;s here.  The latest iPods are sealed very well, and more often than not they require a <i>very</i> thin and flexible bit of metal to make room for Apple&#8217;s Black Stick pry tool.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><b>HD adapters from Addonics: <a href="http://www.addonics.com/products/io/aaedt18ide25.asp">1.8&#8243; to 2.5&#8243; IDE</a> and <a href="http://www.addonics.com/products/io/aa25ide35.asp">2.5&#8243; to 3.5&#8243; IDE</a></b><br />To do testing or erasing on iPod-size hard drives, these adapters will get your 4G-or-earlier drive hooked up to a desktop computer&#8217;s IDE bus.  (For 5G iPods, see <a href="http://www.command-tab.com/2006/11/20/ipod-5g-hard-drives/">this post</a>)  Also not necessary, but again, these are recommended for advanced testing and erasure.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Picking a Hard Drive</b><br />
Depending on your iPod thickness and model, you can choose from the hard drives in the table below.  Note that some of these models are not used in iPods, but should work just fine (for example, the 20 GB ZIF drive, which will only connect to new iPods which <i>start out at</i> 60 GB from Apple &#8212; technically a downgrade, but listed for compatibility information).</p>

<p>You can find many of the above drives on eBay and online retailers, but the most prevalent ones will be models used in iPods that shipped in the past.  I have used many non-Apple-branded Toshiba hard drives without issue, confirming that there is nothing particular about them, except an Apple logo on the sticker.  Having a third party manufacturer such as Toshiba re-brand a product is nothing new to the computer industry &#8212; other big companies like Dell and IBM work deals like this for many components.</p>
<p><b>Hard Drive Preparation</b><br />
Unlike my <a href="http://www.command-tab.com/2005/03/13/ipod-super/">iPod Super</a> hack, a replacement iPod hard drive does not require any special formatting or filesystem preparation.  In fact, I&#8217;ve found that working with a completely empty/zeroed hard drive works best.  If you decided to purchase the adapters listed above, you can connect them as detailed in my <a href="http://www.command-tab.com/2006/04/05/really-testing-ipod-hard-drives/"><i>Really</i> Testing iPod Hard Drives</a> post, and completely erase the hard drive using the handy Darik&#8217;s Boot and Nuke utility (see the comments on that post).  I&#8217;ve found that it works best to have a zeroed hard drive, but it can often be done without.  (The iPod sometimes tries to find software on the hard drive, which may be incorrect for its generation or be corrupted).</p>
<p><b>Opening the iPod</b><br />
To get at the old hard drive, you&#8217;ll need to open the iPod, which is usually the hardest part of the process.  1G through 4G iPods aren&#8217;t as tough as the 5G and later iPods, and can be popped open by pushing the metal backing one way while pulling the plastic front the opposite way.  In doing so, you create a small gap where you can slide in the nylon pry tool and undo the five plastic clips along one of the two longer sides.  The inside top and bottom edges of all iPods are not secured.  Other World Computing has some <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/tech_center/index.cfm?page=Video/directory.html">detailed take-apart videos</a> which should help give you a good idea of exactly how to get inside.</p>
<p>To open a 5G or later iPod, try the first technique above, and use a straight razor as a last resort.  For the really tough ones, work the sharp edge of a new razor perpendicularly into the side seam where the front plastic and back metal meet.  Once wedged between the two halves, tip the dull edge of blade towards the front (towards you), using the iPod&#8217;s plastic side as a fulcrum to open a small space to insert the nylon pry tool.  <b>This is extremely dangerous!</b>  Not only are you working with a super-sharp piece of metal, you&#8217;re flexing its brittle structure, which may cause it to shatter &#8212; so don&#8217;t push too hard.  I&#8217;ve never gotten cut or had a razor shatter while doing this, but only because I took my time and didn&#8217;t get my fingers near the sharp edge.  Moving slow and thinking smart (as smart as bending a razor can be) are keys to making this technique work.  Once the nylon pry tool is in place and has a little room to work, carefully extract the razor and set it aside.  Use the pry tool to work the rest of the side clips open.  If you feel at all uneasy about this method, it&#8217;s probably best to leave it to the professionals &#8212; the 5G iPod is a giant leap forward in design and engineering, at the expense of a lot of end-user serviceability.</p>
<p><b>The Switch</b><br />
After cracking the side of the iPod open, carefully disconnect any audio jack or battery ribbon cables attached to the back panel.  Undoing these connectors often requires the use of the nylon pry tool again, or careful pulling with hemostats.  Be sure to pull the connector straight away from the logic board, using only minor side-to-side wiggling as needed.  Attempting to pry the connector out of its matching socket without keeping it straight can result in the connector separating from its cable!</p>
<p>With the halves unhooked, the panels can be separated, exposing the hard drive.  1G through 4G iPod hard drives can be unplugged by simply pulling the connector straight off the end of the drive, whereas the 5G and later iPods require you to flip up the narrow lever.  It hinges lengthwise along the middle.  The lever does not fold flat backwards when open, but simply stands upright, and should not separate from its other retaining half.</p>
<p>Install the new hard drive in the same direction as the old one, making sure all pins and plastic guides line up.  5G iPods are especially tricky due to the ZIF connector.  Yet again, some tiny tools may come in handy &#8212; just be sure to work gently with its delicate ribbon cable.  Move the metal back panel close to the iPod and reconnect all the cables you unhooked to get into the device, and snap the panel back onto the plastic clips.</p>
<p><b>Restoring in Disk Mode</b><br />
<img src="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/ipod_disk_mode.jpg" align="right" class="right" />Pressing any button will power on your iPod, and you should be able to hear the new drive spin up.  Unless the drive is preloaded with precisely the correct software, you <i>will</i> get a &#8220;sad iPod&#8221; face.  This is okay!  Reset your iPod using the commands detailed <a href="/2006/03/30/hidden-ipod-commands/">here</a>, and immediately hold the Disk Mode keys as soon as the screen blanks for the reboot.  This may take a few tries, but as long as your iPod doesn&#8217;t have the correct data on the drive, you&#8217;ve got all the attempts in the world to get into Disk Mode.  When done properly, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Disk Mode&#8221; at the top of the iPod.  You can now plug the freshly upgraded iPod into your computer and launch iTunes.  After it&#8217;s detected, iTunes may complain about a corrupted iPod.  Dismiss any dialogs and browse to the Summary tab for the iPod, and click Restore.  iTunes will load the proper software onto your iPod, and it will be as good as new &#8212; with more capacity!</p>
<p><b>3/16/08 Update</b><br />
I added the Seagate ST760211DE 60 GB 5mm drive following a painless drop-in replacement report from Jerry Wnorowski:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well it finally arrived, and with just a little hesitation, after all this was entirely new ground for me, I installed the 60GB SeaGate Hard Drive into my broken 30GB iPod Video 5.5 Gen.  When I plugged it in to my laptop, iTunes said it needed to be restored.  I restored it, and it booted and came up in iTunes!!!   I loaded my music, and now I have the thinnest 60GB iPod Video in the world!!</p></blockquote>

A <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/02/240gb-ipod-mod-now-available.ars">240GB iPod modification</a> is now available for those who want TONS of storage space in one portable device.</p>

			<p>I have seen someone take a iPod mini and put a FLASH drive in place of the hard drive it comes with.  I wonder if one can do this with a 3rd gen iPod.<br />
Thanks for all the data.</p>

			<p>Hey, thanks for the post. I bought a 60 gb hard drive on ebay, and the serial number matches one in your list of numbers, but i can&#8217;t seem to get it working on my 3G ipod. could you offer any help? i&#8217;ve tried everything, but when i put it back into the ipod, it always show the folder with the ! in it, and i can&#8217;t seem to figure out exactly what is wrong.</p>

A number of people have asked about upgrading iPod hard drives &#8212; what to buy, how to prepare, and how to perform the upgrade &#8212; so here are all the technical details. If you&#8217;ve never worked inside an iPod before, this is certainly an advanced tut&#8230;</p>

			<p>Dear writer (couldn&#8217;t find your name anywhere),</p>
<p>Some clarification on the iPod-drive combinations. </p>
<p>iPod 3G and harddrives.<br />
The newer MKx006 model harddrives will not (always) work in 3G iPods. This is due to different power requirements for the MKx004 and MKx006 drives. Quite simple: x004 models require low power to spin up and mid power to run. x006 models require high power to spin up and low power to run. This is done to effectively lower power requirements of gadgets like the iPod. The net effect is that x006 HD&#8217;s MAY work in 3G iPods, but most of the time will not. x004 harddrives will most of the time work in 4G iPods.</p>
<p>iPod mini flash conversion<br />
As of next week we will start rebuilding iPod mini&#8217;s with flash memory (4GB and 8GB). You should be able to perform such an action by yourself. Beware: not all flash cards work. Some cards may even fry your iPod or explode (we have proof of this in our lab!). Check out our website for testresults.</p>

			<p>I have a new Toshiba 80GB 1.8-in harddisk MK8009GAH that uses a ZIF<br />
connector, (<a href="http://www.welovemacs.com/mk8009gah.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.welovemacs.com/mk8009gah.html</a>) while my Toshiba<br />
Portege R100 notebook uses a 44-pin (3.3V) connector.</p>
<p>The original harddisk in the notebook is 40GB 1.8-in MK4004GAH<br />
(<a href="http://www.welovemacs.com/132.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.welovemacs.com/132.html</a>).</p>
<p>I need your great help to help me to find a converter that can connect<br />
my ZIF 80GB harddisk to the 44-pin (3.3V) connector in my notebook.</p>
<p>This is something like finding a ZIF to 50-pin (3.3V) converter that allow us to put a 5G hard disk into a 4G and below iPod.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know of any adapter that exists yet &#8212; especially one that connects a ZIF drive to an available 44-pin 1.8&#8243; male connector.  It&#8217;s entirely possible to make it work, but the technologies are so tiny, that it would be tough for anyone without production level equipment to manufacture.  Toshiba does make a 44-pin 3.3v 1.8&#8243; 80 GB drive (wow, that&#8217;s a lot of specs for one drive), the MK8007GAH, but you&#8217;d have to do some exchanging or returning to get ahold of one.  That is, if welovemacs.com even has them.  They exist, so that&#8217;s probably your best move.</p>
<p>To be sure, non-ZIF iPod drives <b>do</b> work in the Portege R100&#8242;s, and vice versa.  They require some formatting and OS-swapping, of course, but the hardware is identical (save for the Apple logo on the drives harvested from iPods).  I&#8217;ve swapped drives between iPods and Portege R100&#8242;s numerous times, using both Ghost 2003 and Acronis True Image to image the proper software as needed.</p>

			<p>With a thicker 4G back plate/audio jack assembly (available on eBay and various parts places), you should be able to max out your 4G iPod to 100 GB :-)  I&#8217;ve pushed it as far as 80 GB, but I don&#8217;t see why 100 GB would pose an issue.</p>

			<p>Hi, first of all love what your doing, nice to see someone with some guts and the skills to match. I saw your aricle about your super ipod and was wondering if it is possible replicate the same idea for the 5th gen ipod. I was thinking of using an ipod with a 3.5&#8243; drive (as large a capacity as possible) for a system in a car. The ipod would be permently built in and it&#8217;s power taken from an in car charger which would connect through a moddifed dock connector which will also allow for audio and video connections to the rest of the car&#8217;s system. The larger drive would allow room for a huge library of music and video etc.</p>
<p>Heres a couple of websites with some interesting products to help: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.span.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28_1203&amp;products_id=14142" rel="nofollow">http://www.span.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=28_1203&amp;products_id=14142</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.span.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=8932&amp;c=102&amp;t=side_right1" rel="nofollow">http://www.span.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=8932&amp;c=102&amp;t=side_right1</a></p>
<p><a href="http://home.swipnet.se/ridax/connector.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.swipnet.se/ridax/connector.htm</a></p>
<p>The first two have ribbons that are compitable with the hard drives used in the 5th gen ipods and so I assume will be compatible with the zif connection on the ipod mainboard. It would great to find out if a 300gb ide drive could be formatted to be used with a 5th gen ipod. I wounder if the video feed from the ipod could be mirrored on several screens too? I would be very interested to hear your response to these ideas, keep up the good work.</p>

			<p>I think the 5G iPod would be a great candidate for a car-based MP3 player, and is most likely able to handle at least 100 GB worth of space, if not loads more.  The only issue is that the ZIF connector on the 5G and higher logic board is not the same as the one on the hard drive &#8212; its pins are staggered (like the contacts on an AGP graphics card).  Getting a working adapter &#8212; from iPod board to 3.5&#8243; or 2.5&#8243; IDE &#8212; would be quite tedious, as it would involve soldering to the ribbon cable.  The hard drive connector is the one directly above the dock connector in the following photo.  Note that it&#8217;s about half the width of the dock connector (which is about the width of the standard ZIF hard drive cable).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/5g_logic.jpg" /></p>
<p>For another view, see <a href="http://media.arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/video-ipod.media/dissection-morechips2.jpg" rel="nofollow">this photo</a> at ArsTechnica.</p>
<p>That second adapter you linked to at Span does work for adapting the 5G iPod drives to 2.5&#8243; IDE (and then, with another adapter, to 3.5&#8243; IDE), however it wouldn&#8217;t help adapt the reverse connection (iPod) to a regular hard drive, as the pins would be entirely backwards.</p>
<p>Ridax&#8217;s items are great!  I highly recommend him.  I bought several dock connectors a while back, as well a breakout circuit board more recently.  See some of the recent photos tagged with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/command-tab/tags/ipod/" rel="nofollow">ipod</a> on Flickr :-)</p>

			<p>Thanks for your reply that was really quick. I was thinking about going from the ipod using the zif cable from the ipod to plug it into the adaptor from span. Since the zif conection on the hard drive seems to be standard apart from the thickness of the cable. And as the zif cable on span is the same at both ends, the cable from the ipod should plug into the adaptor from span, and then convert from 2.5&#8243; to 3.5&#8243;. From the 3.5&#8243; socket use a ide cable and at one end open up the ide plug and seperate all the cables and reconfigure them so that each line goes to the correct terminal. I think you said that you know the pinout out of the zif hard drive, so that it can refernced against a standard 3.5&#8243; cable.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could give detailed instrutions on how you configured your 3.5&#8243; hard drive so that the ipod accepted it in terms of the software methods you used.</p>
<p>I was also wondering about powering the drive, I don&#8217;t think the ipod would be able to supply the power. Would both the hard drive and the ipod have to power at the same time or could either be powered up in no particular order and still result in it being functional and of course in the worse case for no damage to be caused.</p>
<p>If you would like please add me to MSN messenger as I would like to talk to you further on this. It would also be easier to communicate ideas via the white board too. Awaiting your response.</p>

			<p>Hi,<br />
How can this be so easy, and I make it so hard?  I have done just as stated, and the restore will just not take.  I can see the ipod in Windows Explorer, and even click on properties, and when I get to the properties of the Ipod, I can click populate and it will give me the drive info, and says everything is working.  </p>
<p>By the way, I am working on a 20 gig Gen 4.  If I connect to Itunes, it will see the unit and claim it is corrupt.  I was able to work past the 1418 failure, with unplugging and plugging the unit back in, but then it fails with 1415.  I have tried about 20 restores to no avail.  I have now tied to a second computer, and am trying with Itunes version 6 after reading questionable reviews about issue 7.  </p>
<p>When I reboot with 6 I will try again, it is not seen right now.  If it works I will let you know.</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts,<br />
David</p>

What size hard drive are you attempting to use, and are you sure it&#8217;s working?</p>

			<p>I was looking at doing the exact same thing David. I&#8217;ve currently got a 5th Gen Ipod, but I would probably purchase a broken 4th gen off Ebay. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably already thought of this, but could you just hook up the ipod Hard Drive to your main PC using a 3.5&#8243; adapter, and then run Ghost to image the drive to whatever you like?</p>
<p>Let me know what you find out, and good luck!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ben</p>

			<p>Colin, you list only the Toshiba drive which seems to be the only drives apples uses. But I was wondering have you tried or do you know of any issue with the current Samsung(HS060HB) or Seagate(ST760211DE)1.8&#8243; drives?</p>
<p>They are the one with the 60 gigs on a single platter so you wouldn&#8217;t have to upgrade the back of the ipod, theoretically.</p>

			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m continuously getting error 1418 as well, when trying to replace the dead drive in my brother&#8217;s 5g 30gig ipod.  I bought a new toshiba mk3008gal, opened up the ipod, replaced the drive and tried the instructions above but nothing seems to initialize the drive.  itunes 7.1.1.5 gives me the 1418 error, and removing it (including the itl files) and using the ipod updater just states &#8220;can&#8217;t mount ipod.&#8221;  the ipod is willing to charge and go into disk mode, which is an improvement from its previous state&#8230;  this is true with my macbook as well as my xp desktop.  I&#8217;ve unplugged all other usb devices.</p>
<p>in the diagnostics menu I can view the HDD specs and smart data; nothing looks awry.  any advice?</p>

			<p>I bought an 80 GB 5G iPod not long ago. But I have so many CDs and don&#8217;t want to use low quality files (I&#8217;m currently using 320 kpbs AAC; most of my music is classical). How much higher capacity HD could be installed into my iPod. Is the hardware in your list the only choice or there are compatible higher capacity HDs? (Say 120 or 150 GB)</p>

			<p>Excellent guide, thanks.</p>
<p>One of the respondents says that the MKx006 drives usually won&#8217;t work in 3G ipods because of the power requirements.</p>
<p>How about the MKx007 drives (MK8007GAH)?</p>
<p>Are there any good options for 80/100 GB in a 3G ipod?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

			<p>Hi! Read about these iPod HD upgrade articles long time ago, they used to say after HD upgrading, we no longer can use the firewire connection, is that still the case for 4G iPod today? I&#8217;m very tempted to max out my 40GB 4G iPod.</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-101039>Michael</a>: If your new hard drive doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere, and booting into Disk Mode doesn&#8217;t help, certainly your old hard drive should bring it back to its default state.  Since that isn&#8217;t working, try re-seating the cable &#8212; often a loose connection is the problem.</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-101122>Bernie</a>: I have to assume that unless the power requirements are less for the newer drives (the specs should be listed in the white papers from Toshiba), they won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-101184>WoofWoof</a>: That is simply untrue.  I&#8217;ve replaced and upgraded dozens of 4G iPod hard drives and never once lost FireWire capabilities.  The 4G iPods are a rock-solid bunch with plenty of room to grow.</p>

			<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just bought a 60GB hdd for my Gen2 iPod (old school :)<br />
Unfortunately, I had not read through all the comments and discovered a little too late that these hard drives might not work with Gen3 (and as such, I guess Gen2) ipods because of power consumtion.</p>
<p>I wonder if you install also a new battery such as 2200mAh 3.7v, it could solve the problem.</p>
<p>Any idea / advise ?</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

			<p>Hi Collin,</p>
<p>I was just wondering if Daniel (other one) successfully completed his iPod modification, allowing him to run his 5th Generation iPod off a 3.5&#8243; drive in his car. I was about to buy the span 1.8&#8243; to 2.5&#8243; converter and then attempt to connect a 3.5&#8243; to that. In theory this sound like it would work. My question I guess is has it been done successfully and what are the major issues that may cause this plan to fail?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

			<p>The only problem with using the Span adapter is that it was built to connect ZIF drives to a 2.5&#8243; or (with another adapter) 3.5&#8243; IDE interface, not the other way around.  All the pins will be reversed.  The ribbon cable that comes with the Span adapter is straight-through, but there still might be pin reversal issues.  It might be worth a shot, though!</p>

			<p>i can&#8217;t, for the life of me, find any of the MK8007GAH anywhere except for ONE on ebay, currently listed at $737. would have been pretty cool to score one for my ipod photo. what, are there just none left? i might as well buy a new 80gb video.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve just installed an MK8007GAH which I got off Ebay in the US for around $200.  However, despite going through the normal procedures, iTunes still only detects 55GB&#8217;s on what was formerly a 60GB iPod Photo.  In other words, iTunes (presumably because of the firmware) detects no change.  If I try to sync more than 55gb will iTunes recognise it or can I otherwise get round the problem using third party software?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s always a possibility that such a restriction exists, but I&#8217;ve never run into such a thing.  Usually, OEM parts suppliers like to make as few changes as possible to get the product to the engineering guys, which means &#8212; more than likely &#8212; Toshiba simply slapped an Apple logo on the drive&#8217;s sticker and left it at that.  The iPod firmware shouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference between a stock Toshiba drive and an &#8220;Apple+Toshiba&#8221; drive.</p>

			<p>I purchased a replacement drive for my 4G 20gb Ipod (MK2004GAL).  Once replaced I ran the iTunes restore software and now it is telling me I have 3.9gb of available space.  Am I running an incorrect utility or something?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</p>

			<p>i just replaced a broken hard drive in my 60gb 5g ipod, and now when it does boot up it freezes on the apple startup logo, or it just stays black, but you can hear the hard drive spinning inside, once in a while i can get it to work in disk mode, but that is the extent of it. i did get it to boot regularly a few times, but then it froze and never booted again. Any ideas? Thank you.</p>

			<p>This is a wonderful guide! I was wondering if you could possibly update the hard drive chart to state which drives are supported by the 3G iPods (to include Adam Yong&#8217;s statement about power requirements of the MKx006s). I work for a company that&#8217;s starting to replace iPod hard drives, and we bought a bunch of MK3006GALs. They worked just fine in a U2 iPod (4G), but I couldn&#8217;t get any working in a thin 3G (originally a 20 GB). We&#8217;d like to find a drive that will work in these at least at the same capacity if not higher, and we&#8217;d prefer not to use unreliable pulls from other iPods (we like having reseller or manufacturer warranty). What drives will work in a thin 3G?</p>

			<p>I have a Ipod 60gb photo with the un happy face, ive pulled a MK600GAH out of it, but cant seem to find any HDD available &#8211; loks like theve stopped doing these models.   What else is cheaply compatable that fits well?  Would be nice to upgrade it at the same time but may settle for same size disk&#8230; Also i didnt understand the comments above about an adaptor &#8211; does this solve the problem?  Any recommended suppliers?  Thanks for your help.</p>

			<p>I was checking out the toshiba website.  I have a 3G Ipod that I aquired from my brother.  It is a 15G and worked great, but the battery was shot.  After opening it, I decided that I would try to upgrade it as the 10 gigs was simply too small.  Although the HDD was an MK1054, the Ipod itself never showed more than 10 gigs capacity.  Not sure why this is; I&#8217;m quite sure my brother never attempted to mess with the unit.</p>
<p>In any case, I purchased a 40gb back plate on ebay (3mm thicker than the 20gb plate).  I measured the difference in thickness: exactly 3mm as expected.  I had hoped to upgrade to the 80gb, but after checking out the specs on the toshiba website, it was clear that the 80gb had different power requirements.</p>
<p>The mk6006gah, however, had the exact same power specs as the mk1504gal.  Based on that, I purchased the mk6006gah (60gb).  I purchased it 15 minutes ago, so I won&#8217;t be able to say if it works or not for a week or so.  I will report back in about 1-2 weeks.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Toshiba website is great; I have used it for my notebook and my ipod.  The support pages are unmatched by any I&#8217;ve ever had the displeasure of needing.  Easy to navigate and fully informative.</p>

			<p>I tried installing the 60GB MK6006GAH into my 40GB 3G ipod. I couldn&#8217;t get it to work. Earlier posts regarding this seem to be correct in stating that not enough power is achieved to initially spin-up the drive. When I placed the ipod to my ear, I could hear the drive trying to spin-up, but just wasn&#8217;t able to. It immediately gave up and spinned-down.</p>

			<p>Is this list up to date?  I only ask for two reasons&#8230; a) I want to upgrade my 1Gen to the largest possible HD I can find (can&#8217;t for the life of me find the compatible 40GB, even on eBay).  b) Why doesn&#8217;t the 1Gen work with the MK3006GAL?  It seems all the similar models do, is there something weird about the MK3006GAL or is this just an omission?</p>

			<p>Hi.  Following the above instructions, I purchased the Toshiba MK3008GAL drive, which the table above lists as having the ZIF connector.</p>
<p>I received the drive and it does NOT have the ZIF connector; at least, it&#8217;s nothing like the ZIF connector on the Hitachi 08K1575 30 GB drive that I&#8217;m trying to replace.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a 5G Video iPod (black, FWIW).</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m stuck with a Toshiba MK3008GAL drive which I absolutely cannot use, and which my online retailer Keenzo won&#8217;t accept as a return or exchange.</p>
<p>So, two questions: (1) WTF? Why doesn&#8217;t this work as advertised?  and (2) Anybody want to buy a Toshiba MK3008GAL?</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-130420>Steve  H</a>: Your iPod 5G has a Hitachi drive?  That&#8217;s really odd.  Even more odd is how shockingly few Google results that model turns up.  If it&#8217;s used in an iPod, there should be hundreds of results&#8230;</p>
<p>As far as the purchase goes, I think maybe your retailer made a mistake or something.  Every photo and store I can find that sells the MK3008GAL lists and pictures it as having a ZIF connector.  Does the model on the drive exactly read &#8220;MK3008GAL&#8221;, and not, perhaps, MK3008GAH?  Toshiba&#8217;s own documentation shows a ZIF connector (at the end of this PDF):<br />
<a href="http://sdd.toshiba.com/techdocs/MK3008GALUserGuide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://sdd.toshiba.com/techdocs/MK3008GALUserGuide.pdf</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle, but you can probably eBay it as new and get back the money you spent on it :-/</p>

			<p>Hi Collin,</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help so far &#8211; really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I have a 40gb 4g b/w and my drive died after dropping the unit once too often. I just received a replacement (second hand but it passes the hd r+w test on the diagnostics.</p>
<p>But&#8230; I have two problems:</p>
<p>1. it won&#8217;t go into disc mode &#8211; it shows the &#8216;not charged enough&#8217; battery icon when plugged in by usb to my mac&#8230; even though the battery test on diagnostics gives it a 575 (not 710 like new but okay for a few hours)</p>
<p>2. the only other icon it shows is the &#8216;plug into the mains&#8217; one, which I last saw when I installed an update a couple of years ago. Then, plugging it into the mac with the usb cable did nothing, as is the case now. What I had to do was use the firewire cable and mains charger.</p>
<p>Problem here is that I lent a friend my firewire and charger&#8230; so I wonder if there is any way I can kick this sucker into action using the usb cable and my mac?</p>
<p>Any guesses are welcome ASAP as I&#8217;m going away tomorrow and wouldn&#8217;t mind some music for my trip!</p>
<p>Cheers : )</p>

			<p>Hi, I replaced the disk in my 3G iPod with the MK4006GAH.  However, I&#8217;m experiencing the loss of firewire connectivity as observed by several others before me. My MacBook recognizes it as a drive and mounts it but iTunes would hang upon launch and so does Disk Utility. In addition, I would hear clicking sounds from the iPod when connected via FireWire. </p>
<p>USB works as it should but I prefer the convenience of being able to charge/sync my iPod using a single cable. </p>
<p>Would you have any idea why FireWire connectivity is lost on the 3G iPod when replacing the drive? Is there any way for me to re-enable it?</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve recently replaced the hard disk in my 60gb iPod video as the original physically corrupted. I chose to use the 100gb drive listed above. Having installed it and   restored the device using iTunes the iPod only reports the disk space of 74.32gb, the same a 80gb drive would&#8230; <br />
Have you any ideas?<br />

			<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible to convert a thick-body iPod to a thin-body one by replacing the hard drive and backplate with those from a thin model.  As far as I&#8217;m aware, this works for all iPod generations with two thicknesses.  It does not work cross-generation, as internal layouts vary.</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-134754>Ram</a>: If you&#8217;ve tried a couple of formatting programs, you may need to start over with a clean disk.  Try running Darik&#8217;s Boot and Nuke on the iPod drive, perhaps with the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/" rel="nofollow">Ultimate Boot CD</a>.  <b>Unplug every other hard drive except the iPod one before running this.</b></p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-134898>Ets</a>:  I&#8217;ve never tried a Hitachi, but I believe they&#8217;re the same pinout.  You may want to compare power requirements and dimensions to those of the original drive.</p>

			<p>Hi, I did a HD swap in my 4G iPod. I swaped the MK3008GAL with a MK4009GAL. I put the iPod in &#8220;disk mode&#8221; as instructed, but iTunes will not dectect it.  I even install an iPod updater from apple.com on my computer hoping that would help. It did not. Any advice would be appreciatied.  Thank you.</p>

			<p>Hi, it&#8217;s me once again. I finaly found the answer to my question.  I guess I needed to format my new drive, but every time I tried it said it was unformatable.  Then I found this site, <a href="http://www.yavel.com/always/2006/04/ipod_reformat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yavel.com/always/2006/04/ipod_reformat.html</a><br />
and it very easily walked me through the proper way to reformat these drives.  </p>
<p>The hard drive swap advice on this page is very helpful but it should include the reformating instructions.  Maybe someone should update.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great idea on how to save any old dead iPod. That is, if SMACKING the crap out of it wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>

			<p>Hey..after reading this, and a few articles, i was wondering&#8230;see i was looking for a good external hd, and realised that the ipod could also be used in disk mode, so an ipod video could double up as an ipod and hard disk&#8230; however the apple site says that since the ipod filesystem is fat32, you cant store files larger than 4gb, which is exactly what i intend to(games and stuff)&#8230; so i was wondering, is it possible to somehow format the hard disk inside the ipod to NTFS, and then restore from itunes to load the software????<br />
can someone please tell me if it is possible???(just reply in the comments)</p>

			<p>Hi! I dont know if this tread is still open for questions, but I am trying anyway. There is lot of talk here about hooking up the 1.8&#8243; hard drive to the computers IDE-bus using a 1.8&#8243; to 2.5&#8243; adapter. But there are several 1.8&#8243; hard drive enclosures with USB interface on the market. Can you use such an enclosure to do the things you describe (testing. formatting, formatting with zeroes, etc)? I have never worked with 1.8&#8243; but done allot of work on 2.5&#8243; and 3.5&#8243; hard drives using different USB/FW enclosures and I have never had problems with testing, formatting, etc. Is it different with 1.8&#8243; hard drives? Btw, i have worked as a technician at an apple reseller and is of course one of the mac-only buddies ;)</p>
<p>Answers would be deeply appreciated.</p>

			<p>You can probably use a 1.8 to 2.5 adapter (and optional 2.5 to 3.5 adapter) plus a USB or FireWire enclosure to test and format, but I don&#8217;t believe this offers the same depth of testing as native IDE.  If it&#8217;s your only option, though, it may well suffice.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the 1.8&#8243; drives is that they are interface-compatible with larger drives, but on a smaller scale.  The same tests and formats can be applied as with larger drives.</p>

			<p>Collin, Thanks for the answer. I found this article and thread a weak ago, and i have read thru all of it, it is truly a very good article. I cant help noticing that it is was written almost a year ago, and still you are answering questions. That is really remarkable. I just wanted you to know that I think this is awesome, and not to many in todays society put in this type of effort, if they can not instantly gain from it. I do believe that we all get what we put in though, from one source or the other. Keep up the good work :)</p>

			<p>hi i just want to know, it says that 8mm hard drive will fit the 5.5gen, does it mean, if i have a 30gb 5.5 gen i would be able to fit an 60,80gb hard drive w/o changing the backplate since its a 5.5 gen?</p>

			<p>Like previous generations, the 5.5G iPod can accept either size drive, but may need a backplate change if the drive is of the thicker 8mm 2-platter design.</p>
<p>In particular, the 30 GB 5.5G will only house 5mm drives without swapping backplates.  After some time, technology advances allow same capacity drives to reduce to one platter, and then they will fit.  I believe the 80 GB drives have hit this mark, and that 5mm ones are available &#8212; you just need to make sure before you buy.</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-135287>stefan</a>: Yes, the 5.5G 80 GB is the thicker of the two, and should be able to contain the 160 GB (8mm) drive, like the Samsung Spinpoint N2.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure if the battery upgrade is necessary, but it&#8217;s probably best to do it, given the increased screen brightness and slightly different specs.  I&#8217;ve swapped 5.5G parts with a 5G iPod before, and simply brought the battery with the rest of the guts and everything worked beautifully.  Hope that helps!</p>

			<p>I am attempting to upgrade my second gen ipod. I have done this with several 4G ipods for friends and family without any trouble. I put an MK3006GAL in my ipod and plugged it in and it will not restore. When I run the freestanding updater the app crashes. Itunes hangs during the restore or gives an error. When I hook this drive to an external enclosure it works like it should. Is there an issue with using the 30 gig MK3006GAL in lace of the 1003GAL? Any help anybody can offer would be great. I can erase the drive in an external HD enclosure but when I put the drive in the ipod and try the same thing, disc utility hangs. What&#8217;s the deal?</p>

			<p>Upgrading a 2G (firewire version) from 10gig to 20gig: Mechanically, the drive came out and a new one back in OK.  The updater found the iPod, and spent maybe 6 hours performing the RESTORE (I went to bed before it was done).</p>
<p>Now, in the light of morning, the updater instructs me to unplug and replug my iPod, which I do.  My iPod still boots to a exclamation mark folder.  But Windows sees a 20gig HD, where it didn&#8217;t before (that&#8217;s encouraging, maybe).</p>
<p>I re-ran the updater and it finds no &#8220;name, rank, and serial number&#8221; and it offers to RESTORE it for me again.</p>
<p>Did I buy a bad hard drive?  I&#8217;m pretty certain it wasn&#8217;t new (although it was offered as new).  How long should a RESTORE take (6+ hours seems excessive to me)?  What happens after a RESTORE and how long should that take?</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help!</p>

			<p>Howdy!  The wealth of information here is awesome.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my situation: my mom wants an iPod but she doesn&#8217;t need a huge amount of hard drive space &#8211; 10 to 20 gb would be just fine.  Now, I&#8217;ve got an 80gb iPod Video with a broken hard drive &#8211; I&#8217;ve taken it out and it&#8217;s busted, believe me.  Is it possible to downgrade this iPod&#8217;s hard drive to something that small, 10 to 20 gb I mean?  Or am I going to run into problems because the drives that small are the thin size?  I just figured that getting a new smaller size hard drive would be cheaper than buying a whole new iPod, and mom&#8217;s all about saving the bucks &#8211; she won&#8217;t buy one for herself but she&#8217;d take a refurb&#8217;d one from me if I got it worked out for her.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks so much &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never been to this website before.</p>

			<p>Is it possible to replace the iPod HD with a western digital HD? Or any other Portable hard drive? My reasoning is Car Audio based. I know it won&#8217;t fit inside the case, that&#8217;s not the point, would it be possible?  Or how about making the HD itself act like an iPod? You wouldn&#8217;t have a screen and such, but is it possible to get it to operate like one if you tried to sync it to a computer?</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-144631>steve</a>: Nice work!  Glad to hear others are having success upgrading.</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-144727>DoodBoy</a>: Good news, the MK8022GAA appears to be a 5mm drive (not 8mm), so you shouldn&#8217;t need a new backplate or battery :-)  Please comment when you get it going!  I&#8217;d love to add it to the list, and am confident it will work for you.  It&#8217;s a Toshiba drive, ZIF connector, correct thickness&#8230; everything matches up with your 5.5G iPod.</p>

			<p>Alright thanks steve, hope what you are correct!I&#8217;d love to have extra 50gb! I am gonna pay for my item on ebay NOW and take it to the installers ASAP. I appreciate your research time.</p>
<p>I am also quoting the installer service email response to my inquiring regarding &#8220;compatibility&#8221; of my 80gb drive on the 5th gen 30gb ipod, it might serve useful to others or in their decision making to go ahead with upgrade or not.<br />
=======Start QUOTE ======</p>
<p>headphone jack installation cost   $20<br />
if the 80GB hard drive is as thin as the 30GB and if your serial number on the mother board reads  820-1975-a( this number can be found on the top center of the mother board on the screen connector side)this board will read the 80GB hard drive<br />
if you have the 80GB hard drive with the double disc(this will be thicker than the 30GB) and also have  the serial number 820-1975-a on the mother board .you will need to replace the back plate and the earphone jack<br />
if the serial number reads 820-1763-a<br />
this boar will not read the 80GB hard drive<br />
thanks<br />

			<p>great tutorial. and great listings for compatiable hardrives. i have a question though; if you&#8230;lets say, replace the hardrive in an ipod 5GB 1st gen with an Toshiba MK4007GAL 40 GB hardrive, will that decrease the overall battery life due to an increased amount of memory to be accessed? thank you if you could answer my question. Thanks even more for a great reference page!</p>

			<p>@Steve &amp; everyone. Guys The 80gb hard-drive upgrade onto a 30gb ipod was NOT fruitful idea. When I got it installed it gave a SAD FACE meaning it was unable to read the 80gb drive. Thanks you Steve and everyone for such a helpful tutorial. I wanted to come n input so that other benefit too. Upgrade is not a good idea from 30 to 80gb ipod, high chances of not working, i reckon. Prices are falling anyways, it&#8217;s worth buying a new one :-)</p>

			<p>I installed the MK3008GAL in my 30GB video.  I get to the sad face icon and then use the commands to reset and put in disk mode.  I then get the screen that says &#8220;connect to your computer, use itunes to restore.  I plug it in, open itunes and it doesn&#8217;t recognize the ipod.  The ipod now shows the &#8220;do not disconnect&#8221; message for a couple of minutes, then resets and goes back to a message that says &#8220;Please wait. Very low battery&#8221;.  But it has been plugged in all day and when it is in disk mode, shows the battery charged.  <br />
This is my daughters ipod, which she previously used on a Mac, while I&#8217;m trying to restore it on a PC.  Could that have anything to do with it?  She and the computer are away at school, so I can&#8217;t try with the Mac.  <br />
Any thoughts would be very welcome.  Thanks.</p>

			<p>At the 1.8 form factor today we are at disks of 240 GB. Does anyone know if the Ipod Photo has a hardware or software limitation to support those 1.8&#8243; 240 GB disks (some ATA controllers do not go above 160 GB or something like that)?</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-144807>JonnyGuy</a>: More storage should not require more battery power.  Any difference should be nominal.</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-144817>nick</a>: The iPhone and iPod Touch models don&#8217;t have hard drives at all &#8212; they have flash memory storage which, while technically compatible, isn&#8217;t nearly as easy to swap.  It would be quite a challenge, but it&#8217;s theoretically do-able.</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-144834>sfglenrock</a>: It sounds like something else might be amiss with that iPod if it&#8217;s complaining about the battery when it&#8217;s fully charged.  Does it still complain if you boot it up without a hard drive?</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-144844>zinneken</a>: The highest capacity iPod Classic was 160GB, which is well above the 137GB LBA-48 limit some ATA controllers run ap against.  I imagine a 240GB drive would work &#8212; it&#8217;d be the kind of upgrade I&#8217;d like to try, given the hardware :-)</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-144845>Collin</a>: my ipod is the ipod photo, which maxed-out at 60 GB. Also, in those days, we didn&#8217;t have 1.8 or 2.5&#8243; HD over 80 GB if I remember correctly, so there is a big chance that the ATA controller has the 137GB LBA-48 limit?</p>
<p>I remember seeing a post somewhere on the net a while ago that explained how to plug a 3.5&#8243; HD to the ipod (of course no longer portable) &#8230; I&#8217;ve lost track of that post :(</p>
<p>Can anyone who opened up their ipod photo check the controller type?</p>

			<p>Just took it apart again and it may have been as simple as not having the drive hooked into the ribbon connector correctly.  I reconnected, made sure it was pushed in all the way and now it works great.  Thanks.</p>

			<p>@<a href=#comment-144848>zinneken</a>: I&#8217;m not sure if the iPod Photo can handle that much storage.  Perhaps <a href="/2005/03/13/ipod-super/" rel="nofollow">this</a> post of mine is the one you&#8217;re referring to?  I&#8217;ve not tried it with a Photo, unfortunately.</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-144851>sfglenrock</a>: Cool, nice work!</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-144854>Michael</a>: A thin hard drive will work, but you&#8217;ll have leftover empty space that will need to be filled with foam or something.  Or, you could replace the metal backplate with a thinner one.</p>

			<p>I replaced the dead Seagate ST1 drive in my daughter&#8217;s 2nd gen iPod Mini with a 4 gb Peak Compact Flash card p/n 751ccf0068. Easy and inexpensive replacement, iPod works perfect now. Card was around $25. Ordered from O2 Brands (their part number is pkcf-4gb). Card was just a little bit thicker than the Seagate drive, but fit just fine. They also have larger capacity cards if you want to spend a bit more.</p>

			<p>Hi,<br />
I&#8217;ve been searching for some months now how to replace my 30GB iPod Video with a flash memory. In this period I came onto websites that recommend Compact Flash Cards together with a flash to ziff connector. Is it also possible to use a SolidState disc? or preferably a 32GB USB Stick, or at least using it compounds? Because a 32GB USB Stick is cheaper than a Compact Flash card. Maybe one of you can explain me why it is so much cheaper or why it could never work in an iPod?</p>
<p>regards,<br />

			<p>I know this is about a year and a half later, but I dropped my ipod in water and found that you can open it up with a guitar pick and you don&#8217;t need fancy tools. Also, there are little tabs that you flip up so you don&#8217;t have to just pull the ribbons out, so look out for those- The ones for the battery are brown, and the one for the hard drive is black and you&#8217;ll see it where the orange ribbon connects. To open it, just put your fingernail under the opposite side of the black tab and pull up towards you and it&#8217;ll pop up, allowing you to remove the ribbon easily and without wiggling back and forth, which is dangerous.</p>

			<p>This is a timeless article that is nearly up to date more than 1.5 years later.  It truly is a piece of work that took time to research and update and will continue to aid the aftermarket community for years to come.

I was thinking if I was going to open up my iPod for the battery, I might look into increasing the hard drive to max it out.  I found the following and would like to update your list:<br />

			<p>Hi Harrier.. Have you tested these drives, or did you just find some drives that would fit in theory? Because i would love to have the Toshiba MK1231GAL 120 ZIF 5mm Thin 5G, 5.6G, 6G Classic in my ipod video 5.5 30 gb, but im not sure if this combination would work.. Some guys at rapid repair said, that it wouldnt :s</p>

			<p>Need somehelp &#8211; I connected new, 30G drive blanked out (partition removed) to 4th gen ipod, got sad face. Ipod will not go into disc mode, iTunes will not recognize it.<br />
Tried again with the drive formatted with FAT32 on the PC and the result was the same.<br />
Any suggestion how to get the Ipod recognized by iTunes to revive it will be appreciated.<br />
Th iPod is happily working with the old 20G for now, but I would like to get the bigger drive into it.</p>

No I have not yet tried it myself.  This is a great blog and I would hate to screw someone up.  The original high capacity of the video ipod was 80G, maybe there is a controller hardware issue and I spoke prematurely.  Gosh, if that&#8217;s true I would feel awful. </p>
<p>I tried calling the same company 1 year ago and they told be the same thing when before I installed an 80GB on my sisters previous 30 GB 5.5 Gen video iPod.   They tried to sell me a bigger battery, back cover and thicker hard drive.  Nuts. They gave me no physical explanation why it couldn&#8217;t be done except saying it was not possible. Apple themselves said the same thing and also pointed to a website that didn&#8217;t mention why it wouldn&#8217;t work.I tried the 80G 5mm it and it worked perfectly.  What annoys me about Rapid Repair was even after I spoke to them and let them know I did it, they still haven&#8217;t changed the website to show the 5mm hard drive works in the thinner 30G and still try to sell you the same hardware.</p>
<p>From what I see, there is no physical difference between the 80G I installed in my sisters iPod than with than 120G and see nothing preventing it from working or me trying.   I have been working a lot of OT for a long time (65 hours) each week for about a year and now on vacation, but the only reason I didn&#8217;t try it was because I couldn&#8217;t fin it with the time I had.  Could Rapid Repair be right, Yes.  Has Rapid repair been wrong in the past-heck yes. Perhaps Collins may have an idea if I&#8217;ve blown smoke by accident or if it works.  Frankly, from what I see, he appears to be more on top of this than anyone else. </p>
<p>Collins:  Any input?</p>
<p>
What reason did rapid repair give you why it wouldn&#8217;t work</p>

<p>I have not tried the drives.  I have a 30GB  5.5Gen video ipod.  I pulled the specs and posted it.  To me if the connector, architecture and size is the same, you should be go to go.  Since the original article was posted, new drives have come out. My goal as to try to help since the 6th Gen came out.  I&#8217;m assuming yo also have a 30GB too and concerned about the $$.  Unfortunately, I cannot find a drive that I believe if from a god source.  I don&#8217;t feel comfortable buying it from China or Hong Kong.</p>
<p>My goal is to take the back panel I have and see if I can figure out how to redesign and re-work internals so the thing come apart like it should.</p>

I just called Rapid Repair and pushed them for a reason why it wouldn&#8217;t work.  They told me they don&#8217;t carry the Toshiba MK1231GAL 120 ZIF 5mm and don&#8217;t know if it works about the compatibility ad directed me to this link <a href="http://www.rapidrepair.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2164" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapidrepair.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2164</a></p>
<p>Let me ask you this, why do you think it wouldn&#8217;t work?  I&#8217;m trying to get the HD from a reliable source.  I&#8217;ve been told I can get it or $120-130 on ebay.  Sorry, for this type of part, I want to get it from a reputable source.</p>

			<p>Sorry for the double post &#8211; killerbee230 &amp; Johannes is the same person :) Thank you for all your information</p>
<p>I read the comment from RapidRepair in this forum: <a href="http://www.rapidrepair.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;p=5645" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapidrepair.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;p=5645</a> they dont say why, they just say it wont work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m assuming you also have a 30GB too and concerned about the $$. Unfortunately, I cannot find a drive that I believe if from a god source. I don’t feel comfortable buying it from China or Hong Kong.&#8221;<br />
Yes thats very true.. I dont wanna waste money on a fake/used drive, or a drive that just dont work in my iPod video. Still.. I want the largest 5mm drive i can get, and right now the only one i can find that would work is the MK1231GAL.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me ask you this, why do you think it wouldn’t work?&#8221;<br />
Actually i think it would work. I&#8217;ve compared all the specs with the original 30gb drive, and the size, power consumption etc. shouldnt be a problem. I just got confused, when i heard that the drive wouldnt work in the video. The wierd thing is, that noone has attempted this upgrade before, but still, they say that it wouldnt work. Maybe its some limitations in the controller chip? But AFAIK you should at least have a drive 160GB&lt; before large drives is a problem with older controllers &#8211; especially if the controllers can use 80gb large drives. If i had the money to waste, i would buy the MK1231GAL and try for myself, but right now i just want to have a working iPod :)</p>
<p>Btw. Which 80gb drive did you install in your sisters ipod?</p>

			<p>Great information here.. I guess I have one very basic question not covered in the initial article. Replacing a 5th Gen 30gb with a 60gb (8mm) drive &#8211; can this be squeezed into the slim 30gb enclosure? If not, and if buying a deeper back plate, will the battery have to be replaced? And will I need to replace the jack &amp; hold switch too? This will be useful to others as I&#8217;ve not found a definitive answer on the net..</p>

			<p>Azillo, actually Dan Collins does cover this topic in his original article. If all you want to do is upgrade your 30 GB 5th gen video iPod from 30GB to 60GB, the only expense you need is buying a new hard drive that is 5mm with a ZIF connector.  That is the beauty of the tables be created.  Seagate, ST760211DE, 60 GB ,ZIF 	5mm, Thin will work.  You will not need a new back panel or anything else. If your ipod is also losing battery power, like mine, you may want to install a new battery. Although I&#8217;m still not sure what works best in the 30 g Video ipods because of the smaller size. Are the longer lasting ones worth it-maybe Dan knows. </p>
<p>Killerbee230<br />
For me, I just want to try it.  For me, it takes a long time to get the cover off.  There are 2 wires on the corners,but I forgot what sides.  The key is taking off the front panels without damaging those ribbons.  You must be very patient and careful.  I used a 2 guitar picks and wierd pliers that function like hemostats.</p>
<p>I have a friend in Japan who is checking and seems to believe the 120 G drive is made in China. Since Apple is already using them in their new classic iPods and this HD has applications in camcoders, I have no idea why it&#8217;s not widely distributed in the US.  HD space on iPods is very much like fog lights (With respect to HD space),I would rather have them and not need them than to need them and not have them.I&#8217;m concerned why Toshiba doesn&#8217;t seem to sell them easily through distributors</p>

			<p>I checked the Toshiba website and they now have a 1.8&#8243; HD section in their date storage section.  Unfortunately, the 100 and 120 GB for 1.5&#8243;mm height is not indicated.  But if you look at the drives they make, you can find them to compare with the other drives they listed.  The phone number I called for their US storage devices division is 1.800.316-0920. When I called, I was told there was a 20 minute wait at 1:00PM Pacific time &#8211; so I hung up. It maybe, because of the new release the 1.5mm simply haven&#8217;t caught up with their aftermarket distribution cycle</p>

			<p>Now I&#8217;ve heard murmuring that the premier 4G (black-line LCD) iPod is picky about the hard drives it will upgrade to as opposed to the 4G color LCD&#8217;s (photo and such) that were released a short time later. In theory this is accurate (when talking about limits with controllers and other interfaces on the motherboard), so you are policed when crossing this border. I&#8217;ve nearly had to sell blood and semen finding some of the drives in this list online to see if they work with the 4G black-line LCD that was originally 20 gig&#8217;s (many 3Gs do NOT work, 4Gs are vague as to the LCD orientation and original gig&#8217;s (apparently matters), 5Gs and up are a stong bet on NO)</p>
<p>So does anyone know (or has proven) what the largest capacity a 4G (black line LCD) will support? It appears to be the cut-off to an era of iPods compatability&#8230;</p>
<p>And with current pricing around $250 for a brand new 120gig iPod classic&#8230;I need to find a sweet deal on a very large upgrade for my black-line LCD 4th Generation U2 iPod that will make it worth the effort.</p>
<p>Any advice or proven drives (and pricing) is MUCH appreciated!</p>

			<p>Hi..</p>
<p>-Drew<br />
No, the controller on the iPod can&#8217;t access drives that large</p>
<p>-Harrier<br />
&#8220;I have a friend in Japan who is checking and seems to believe the 120 G drive is made in China&#8221; That would explain why you cant find them other places than Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The wierd thing is, that i have no problems opening the iPod. I just use a wierd plastic tool i had lying around, and it works perfectly. Right now i just need a new drive to replace the 30GB drive. What drive did you put in you sisters ipod &#8211; you forgot to tell me :)</p>

Sorry, I missed your request earlier.  I used the Toshiba MK8022GAA 80G ZIF 5mm Thin on my sister&#8217;s iPod.  But, the Sumsung HS081HA 80G ZIF 5mm Thin should be just as fine also</p>

			<p>Collin or Anyone else that may be able to help,</p>
<p>Ok everyone, here&#8217;s the deal.  I&#8217;ve gotten a dead 4G 40 gig Ipod from a friend who replaced it with a new Ipod.  I consulted this forum several weeks ago to see if it was worth trying to fix.  After which I ordered a replacement 60 gig HD to plug into it.  I received the new drive a couple of days ago.  To be specific I&#8217;m replacing the Toshiba MK4004GAH with a new Toshiba MK6006GAH.  After replacing the HD and starting up the Ipod it continually shows the folder with ! and constantly recycles.  Almost as if it keeps shutting down restarting.  I&#8217;ve been able to get it into disk mode as instructed above.  Connected it to my PC and haven&#8217;t been able to detect it either in Windows or Itunes.  I&#8217;ve tried it on two different pc&#8217;s running XP and Vista both.  Also, once I&#8217;ve gotten it into Disk Mode it doesn&#8217;t seem to want to do anything else, it freezes.  Am I missing something here, is there anything else I need to try?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I&#8217;ve undone and reseated the HD cables probably about 6 times and my frustration level is just about over the top.  Thanks guys.</p>

			<p>Thanks killerbee230.. I actually got the trick with the 5mm 60gb, but found the Seagate difficult (and a little expensive) to buy in the UK (it&#8217;s officially &#8216;discontinued&#8217;). I&#8217;ve now ordered the 8mm Toshiba, bought an 80gb back plate and a new battery. I guess I&#8217;ll find out soon if there are any issues with the jack &amp; hold switch..</p>

			<p>It is my understanding iPod hard drives should not require any special formatting or filesystem preparation. Collins appears to indicate that working with a completely empty/zeroed hard drive works best.  Are you saying you tried Restoring in Disk Mode outlined above and still having problems? If not, please read carefully and try again.  May I ask where you purchased the hard drive?</p>

			<p>iPod Hacker.  I have been told that Apple has adjusted its firmware to prevent certain sizes hard drives from being allowed to be used on its iPod.  I received this information from a retailer. The general rule of thumb is Apple will continue to discount the price of their 120GB iPod as the price of the hard drive declines. Once Apple has gotten their profit and sees that the hard drives are so cheap they are not worth selling anymore, they will then allow larger sized hardware to work.  Despite claiming to be green, Apple will not announce it deliberately to try to get the maximum amount of people to buy their iPod.  Apple will also try to prevent customers from getting the hard drives by signing contracts with Toshiba to limit it&#8217;s distribution to prevent people from figuring out how to hack it.  </p>
<p>When some figured out how to hack the iTouch and allow it to work like the iPhone, Apple was forced to lower it&#8217;s price on the iPhone.  This is the game that people must play when buying an apple.  Since there are many mp3 and mp4 players, I&#8217;m now looking at other players that will allow use of the Hard drives.  This marketing tactic to actually build in obsolescence and prevent upgrading is against everything I stand for.  There is a limit to how much a company can take from my pockets and ask me to keep coming back. Zune is the same way-two birds of the same feather.  When I buy something, I expect it to last.  This is bull crap.</p>

			<p>ipod hacker.  I just called Rapid Repair and they told me they are successfully using the Samsung 80GB in their 30gb ipods.  Although the never tried, they say they know of no reason why your 120gb would not work.  Please clean it and try again.</p>

			<p>killerBee 230, Mike at Rapid repair is using the 80GB HS081HA for the 30 gb video Ipod 5.5 gen. It&#8217;s less expensive than Toshiba </p>
<p>iPod Hacker, Mike also indicated he has tried the 120 GB drive and also couldn&#8217;t get it to work. I will try to check with a different source to see if Apple has done something to prevent the graphics from working with the 120 G</p>

			<p>iPod hacker.  Don&#8217;t get rid of your drive.  On order to get the 120G working, you will need load classic software into your 5.5 Gen hard drive.  If you are what your name implies, my guess is you should not have any problems.  Can you tell me where you got your hard drive? I would like to buy one.</p>

I hope that apple didnt modify the firmware like you say, then we&#8217;re pretty f****d</p>
<p>But can you get classic software on the old ipod video? Isn&#8217;t it a different chipset?</p>
<p>The drive you were talking about, is that the 5mm version?</p>
<p>I would also like to hear where you got the drive from, i cant find it anywhere but ebay</p>
<p>Im sorry that i cant help you so much, but please ask anyway if you need any, i might be able to help someway.</p>
<p>I hope you can get it working &#8211; good luck again :)</p>

			<p>ipodhacker, Harrier</p>
<p>I have bought MK1231GAL from eBay, and tried to install it into the 5.5G 30GB iPod. but it doesn&#8217;t work.<br />
Maybe I met the same situation which ipodhacker met.<br />
I also have 5.5G 60GB iPod, so of course I tried to install this 120GB HDD to my thick iPod 5.5G, but it became the same situation.</p>
<p>When I install the HDD and tried to restore it with iTunes, the error pop up which told &#8220;unknown error (1416)&#8221; came out and the restore process ended abnormally.<br />
Disk error 1416 seems to be &#8220;Resource Busy&#8221;. I can&#8217;t even format iPod disk with Disk Utility, with Drive Genius 2, and also with Diskwarrior.</p>

			<p>azillio-I installed an 80 gb Hard drive in my sisters 30 GB 5.5 Gen iPod.<br />
 Piejesu-I too thought the 120GB HD would work on the 30GB Video iPod and was in the final phases of checking with iPod repair facilities before buying the drive.  Unfortunately after I announced that, people started buying the drive before I was able to collect that information.  When I was told that many had tried and tried buy were unable to get the 120GB hard drive to work and that Apple has been known to prevent the largest hard drives from working on its earlier firmware and was performing further research to warn other others, I discovered people had already acted in purchasing the hard drive. With that as a back drop, I then started performing further research.</p>
<p>I personally don&#8217;t like the 6th Gen firmware mainly because for three reasons: 1) Coverflow looks like it was crammed in quickly to try to fit on a tiny screen and is impractical to use-it&#8217;s on function purpose is to show off. 2) The spit screen is OK, but eventually makes the software look cheap and cluttered.  3) The classic output jack functionality has been altered to prevent using the normal inexpensive cables to use the Apple&#8217;s customized cables-In other words, I preferred and enjoyed the additional functionality of the 5.5 gen over the 6Gen firmware.  </p>
<p>That said, knowing you already purchased the 120GB hard drive for the 5.5 Gen or 5.0 Gen Video iPod, ad it will not work because Apple has blocked it in that firmware; the only opportunity you have is either using the 6.0 on your iPod or installing third party software that allows you to install the hard drive.</p>
<p>The immediate problem I see with that is the classic comes with a slightly larger screen and different functionality for the hardware jack. So even if yo magically had classic firmware on your current iPod, there&#8217;s no guarantee audio and video would work well.</p>
<p>I believe I may have a solution that may work, but haven&#8217;t had an opportunity (time) to test it.  If you like, and you would like to try my idea yourself, I think I can impart what I think is a solution so you can try it yourself providing you don&#8217;t post it on the web if it works.  There appear to be solutions to this already on the web, but they are written in forms that are masked to address different problems, but at a level were others are sophisticated enough to also understand implications of how those answers can be applied to possibly addressing your particular situation. If you are interested, let me know and we can arrange a mutual time to connect and I will tell you how and where in way way you will not have to post your e-mail address on the web.  If Collins wants, he can also join.  Allow me some time to do  little beta testing.  I&#8217;m a little new to this world and still rough around the edges, but think I may have the a shot at addressing your current problem</p>

			<p>I was wondering.. Maybe its possible to create an image from all the partitions on the old 30 gb harddrive, and move that image to the large 120 gb drive with a program like partition magic etc.</p>
<p>I read about some who faced the same problems when they tried to replace a harddrive in an iRiver or something, and this solution worked</p>
<p>If you do it like this, the ipod might think that the drive hasent been replaced, but it just have gotten bigger. Then you dont need to reformat anything, and then you avoid the limitation. I dont think the limitation is in the hardware/firmware, because IpodHacker could read the SMART info w/o probs. I think the limitation is in the reformat software in itunes. This software may not allow drives that large to be reformatted</p>
<p>The problem with this method is, that you gonna need a working 30gb drive, a working 120gb drive and some kind of adaptor so you can connect the ZIF drive to the pc.</p>

			<p>Harrier, sand the other iPod masters,</p>
<p>At least in my case, yo are not responsible because I haven&#8221;t read this thread until yesterday.<br />
When I met the trouble with MK1231GAL and look for the resolution and find this thread.<br />
But I am very intrested in your idea, and I want to co-work with all of you.</p>
<p>By the way, as I told above, I have 60GB iPod 5.5G. And last month I bought 120 GB Toshiba HDD with 8mm height, and install it into this thick 5.5G iPod. And it works perfectly.<br />
So I wonder iPod firmware have any limitation about the amount of HDD, and now I suppose that MK1231GAL itself has some limitation about pin assign, for example.<br />
I am now ordering an external 1.8 inch  HDD case in order to examine the HDD itself. <br />
I think this examination will match the purpose of KillerBee230.<br />
If you have any idea to try, please let me know.</p>

			<p>In addtion, I found at the other discussion board that someone tried to install MK1231GAL into MacBook Air, but it can&#8217;t be formatted by Mac OS Disk Utility.<br />
At the other site, I read that it could be installed into iRiver HP 120(?) .<br />
So, I think we need a proffetional skill about HDD and especially about PATA interface, in order to solve this problem. This may be hard work.</p>

			<p>At the Toshiba Official HP, they say that MK1231GAL is ATA-3/-4.<br />
 <a href="http://www3.toshiba.co.jp/storage/english/spec/hdd18/31.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www3.toshiba.co.jp/storage/english/spec/hdd18/31.htm</a><br />
On the other hand, many other HDD which are used by iPods are ATA-6/-7.<br />
Is this any hint of solving this problem, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

			<p>Sorry guys that i haven&#8217;t had the time to reply in the thread.(Christmas and all)<br />
Using ubuntu 8.10 i can create partitions, i get an error but the partition(s) appears, but i cant format them at all<br />
Using windows xp/vista32/vista64 on different computers the volume manager sometimes appear after a long time showing the drive. but i can do anything with it.<br />
i am reading on <a href="http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?fat32format.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?fat32format.htm</a> , and trying to use his fat32format but it doesn&#8217;t work very well either.<br />
i think the problem is on the firmware on the ipod video 30gb,or maybe hardware,, but i think its the firmware.<br />
i bought the drive from rapidrepair.<br />
using disk mode vista64 with fat32format i get&#8221;This drive is too small for FAT32 &#8211; there must be at least 64K clusters&#8221;, will try to make a partition and go from there.</p>
<p>ipodhacker was just a name, nothing to imply something =).. i know my way around firmwares,hacking pda&#8217;s and such, but havent try to hack an ipod firmware yet, just rockbox =).</p>
<p>Harrier, hmm do you have a guide for loading the classic firmware to the ipod video?, there is a problem thou,, with classic firmware, rockbox wont work, but never mind. would like to get the 120gb drive working.<br />
Btw. im interested, and i wont post something on the web if told so.<br />
&#8220;Mail (will not be published) (required)&#8221; is a real one now</p>

			<p>OK.  I too am new to this and with the holidays am pretty busy.  I can try this on my 30GB first, but new to this and believe three heads are better than one. If my information is correct, this solution maybe simpler way to solve your problem. For  Piejesu and ipodhacker where do you live and what time zone are you in?  I live in California USA.  My purpose is have either a meeting on the web or call you both on a conference call at a time when we all have time. I would like to have a meeting sometime after Dec 25 and Jan 1.</p>

			<p>Harrier,<br />
I live in Japan, and I am a Japanese.<br />
Your suggestion seems very interesting, but perhaps I cannot take part in the telephone conference, because of my language. I am not good at real time hearing/speaking in English. Writing/reading is better than conversation, but I cannot write/read English without enough time to understand your comments, and a dictionary.<br />
I am so sorry.</p>
<p>By the way, I got the HDD case and I did some test today.<br />
As ipodhacker mentioned above, MK1231GAL cannot be formatted as an external HDD drive, by neither Windows nor Macintosh. It becomes &#8220;input/output error&#8221;.<br />
At the same time, I have MK8010GAH (80GB), which is originally installed in my thick 5.5G iPod ( Now MK1214GAH (120GB) is installed in this iPod).<br />
MK8010GAH is not on the Toshiba website, so it seems to be a custom model for Apple.<br />
I tried MK8010GAH to format with same HDD case, but it failed with the same error (input/output error). I am quite surprised, because this HDD have worked in the iPod perfectly.<br />
So, now I guess the input/output error at formatting is not the cause of that MK1231GAL cannot be installed into iPod. Very mysterious.?</p>

			<p>I live in Sweden GMT+1 so it might be better to have a meeting on the web/mail etc.<br />
It seams like for importing new firmware in the ipod the 30gb disk must be present,not the new 120gb.</p>

			<p>ipodhacker &amp; Piejesu. This first step &amp; simplest method to get the 120G drive to work on your 5.5 Video iPod would to try to copy firmware from the Video iPod Classic hard drive to your new hard drive.  This will certainly get the hard drive to work.  Do you have access and ability to do this?</p>
<p>If this does not work for you, the next step will be more complicated and difficult to perform.  The next step make also require experimentation and patience on your part.</p>
<p>May I have Dan send you my e-mail address?</p>
<p>Piejesu, if you are not able to copy firmware, I will try to send you the next instructions in Japanese because they are technical.</p>
<p>ipodhacker &amp; Piejesu how do you write English so well?</p>

<p>I found the document above, which says;</p>
<p>The 1.8-inch MKxx31GAL HDD series uses a new mechanical and firmware design for enhanced durability, making the drives well suited for slim-line mobile gadgets and PC applications. </p>
<p>That is, the firmware may change and it may be incompatible with old iPod, now I guess&#8230;</p>

Thanks for your suggestion.<br />
My comment No.202 was written without your No.201, so something not meet. (^^;</p>
<p>At this moment, I am sorry to say I have no idea to get iPod Classic firmware and copy it to.<br />
I am very pleased if you send me the next instructions. Maybe English is OK.</p>
<p>&gt;ipodhacker &amp; Piejesu how do you write English so well?<br />
Thank you. But I always have to take a lot of time to read/write English, with my dictionary.</p>

			<p>Harrier, yes, Dan can send you my e-mail. <br />
The problem is that with the original firmware i cant format and copy things to the new 120gb drive, so any firmware upgrade must be done with the old 30gb drive, and then install the 120gb drive and check if we can format it there.<br />
so. ipod video with 30gb drive=&gt;upgrade to classic firmware=&gt;replace drive to 120gb=&gt; try restore/format/etc.<br />
but will the classic firmware work on the video ipod?, or is it a modified classic firmware to fit on the video?</p>

			<p>Hi.. You could also try transfering the built in hdd firmware from the 8mm 120GB drive to the the slim drive. I dont know if these drives are similar enough though. </p>
<p>I dont think it would work if you copy the classic firmware to the drive &#8211; the hardware in the 5g &amp; 5.5 / 6g ipods are too different.</p>
<p>Btw. Did any of you try the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool to format your harddrives? <a href="http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=197" rel="nofollow">http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=197</a></p>

			<p>ipodhacker, I have the same question you have.<br />
The problem is that there is no way to format or read/write at this moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://ipodhacking.com/forum/ipod-video-hacks-resources/5499-replacing-harddrive-5-5-twist.html" rel="nofollow">http://ipodhacking.com/forum/ipod-video-hacks-resources/5499-replacing-harddrive-5-5-twist.html</a></p>
<p>I read this thread, and know the HDD inside iPod classic can be install into iPod 5.5G, if there is formatted at once.<br />
So, now I am planning to buy a iPod classic (junk or second-handed) in order to format my MK1231GAL. After that, it may become to be recognized by my iPod 5.5G.</p>
<p>How about this idea, Harrier &amp; ipodhacker?</p>

			<p>Thank you KillerBee<br />
I have tried the HP tool which you told now.<br />
The tool could recognize MK1231GAL in the USB HDD case, but when I pushed the &#8220;Start&#8221; button, the error message &#8220;Device media is write-protected&#8221; came out and failed formatting.</p>
<p>I guess now this drive is protected to format only by iPod classic or Zune, not by iPod 5.5G.<br />
I also think the firmwares are much different between 5.5G and 6G, but I guess that the disk becomes to be able to be written/read after it is formatted by iPod classic and we can overwrite the firmware from 6G to 5.5G. (I hope it, rather than I guess)</p>
<p>By the way, I ordered a Junk iPod classic at an auction site in Japan, which is like eBay,<br />
and am waiting the arrival of it. As soon as I get it, I will try and report the result to you.</p>

			<p>I received the ordered Junk iPod classic, and then I tried.<br />
As a result, I could not make MK1231GAL working in iPod 5.5G. (ToT)</p>
<p>At first, I installed MK1231GAL into iPod classic and restored it successfully.<br />
So, at this moment I could format this HDD.<br />
Then, I take out the HDD from iPod Classic, and installed it into iPod 5.5G.<br />
When I connect iPod 5.5G with my Mac, iTunes started and the message came out which tells me that I need to restore it.<br />
So, I push the button on iTunes to restore it, but for a while, the error message came out which tell the same 1416 error.</p>
<p>After that, I connect it with Windows PC and tried to use HP tool which KillerBee told, but the error message “Device media is write-protected” came out again and failed formatting.</p>
<p>So, I think the time to give up for me is comming near by&#8230;.</p>

			<p>Hey guys, was wondering if ya&#8217;ll could help me with a question. I&#8217;ve got a 80GB 6G Classic that needs a new HDD. It came with a Samsung HS081HA Drive and I was wondering since it has got to be replaced is there any reason I can&#8217;t upgrade to a 120GB or 160GB replacement drive. Are there different power requirements for the larger drives? would I need to upgrade the battery as well? Are  the drives the same size? Can you think of any reason why a larger drive would not just &#8220;slip in&#8221;?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

			<p>Piejesu if you transferred the firmware from the classic HD to the 5.5 Gen properly and it still doesn&#8217;t work, than Apple has done more to prevent that from working.  I will ask more questions from my friend at my end tomorrow.  The firmware would be the simplest method to making it work an if it doesn&#8217;t, it needs to be investigated</p>
<p>Adam:<br />
The hard drive you have is 5.0 mm thick. For your device, a 120 Hard drive can fit and work in your device, but because the 160 G is thicker at 8.0mm, you will not be able to use that hard drive unless you get a back plate to accommodate the additional space</p>

Thank you for your investigation.<br />
I have read at iPodWizard site that the firmware of iPod classic is encrypted and it is very hard to extract it from iPod itself. If it is, it is very hard way, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

			<p>Hi..</p>
<p>My last post wasn&#8217;t posted so i try again. Maybe the harddrive is locked in the firmware. You could try reading about how to unlock it on this website: <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=555334" rel="nofollow">http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=555334</a></p>
<p>Especially the link to the rockbox site is interesting.. You might try that one out: <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/lock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockbox.org/lock.html</a></p>

			<p>Werner, the drive that Apple uses is a Samsung MFG SKU  HS161JQ.  The drive is an 8mm and will not fit with you 80G or 120GB back panel.  The 160GB I listed is less expensive than the Toshiba.  In order to make it work you will need a thinker back panel to handle the additional room.  If you are doing that, you will also be able to install a stronger battery that lasts longer.  <br />
Piejesu, Ipod Hacker KillerBee230, please e-mail me at a junk e-mail <a href="mailto:harrier.1@live.com">harrier.1@live.com</a>  I don&#8217;t know if my solution will work an have a friend who believes he can do it, but looks like it will take some time. I tried asking Dan to help e-mail Piejesu and Ipod hacker with some instructions and my e-mail address.  Evidently with the holidays or his policy, it was not sent.</p>

			<p>Sorry Adam, I&#8217;m putting in a lot of hours at work.  The MK2431GAH 240 8MM ZIF thick should certainly fit into the 160G classic and your battery will have no problems.  If you recall, Apple for the 5.5G Video iPod and all other models, does everything it can try to build obsolescence by putting limits on the the hard drive memory it can handle.  It does not appear to be related to the firmware, but possibly the control cards as Dan indicated above.  Nobody has tried the 240G, but hardware wise it should work, but if Apple has put a hard drive limit on it highest end models (you are aware Apples largest video iPod is 160 and that is no longer being sold because quality complaints it is too slow and loud).   The 240G is a double platter just as your 160G.  The 240G is actually faster than the 160G-It&#8217;s a gamble I don&#8217;t think can work, but I can call rapid repair if you like and ask them</p>

			<p>THANK YOU THANK YOU for blogging how to do this. I was able to switch my 5G hard drive this morning. It was hard but I think I did it.</p>
<p>A quick note, I found the explanation of the zif connector on the hard drive is a little confusing. I didn&#8217;t understand where the bar is and ended up just pulling the ribbon cable out. Miracle I didn&#8217;t break it. </p>
<p>There is a little bar (black on the toshiba drives) on the drive&#8217;s connector, where the pins are. This clamps the pins down. If you flip this up 90 degrees the ribbon cable should slide out w/ a very gentle pull. When putting it back, make sure the bar is up, and slide it back in gently. Then clamp the bar back down to secure the pin connection. If you&#8217;re using forceps or an IC tool be careful where on the ribbon you clamp, so that you don&#8217;t damage the electrical traces on the cable.</p>

			<p>Can&#8217;t wait to try this out!!!<br />
Does anyone know how you would go about plugging an external hard drive into an iPod and playing stuff off there. I was thinking, rather than upgrade the iPod HD to another 1.8&#8243; one, you could maybe use a larger HD around 500GB and create a way to plug this external hd into the iPod. <br />
Any help with this idea and I would be truly greatful!</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to reflect a question above, to which I might have misse dthe answer.  I have a MK8009GAH that came with no ZIF connector.  How do I use the one in my IPOD?  I&#8217;m going to have to disconnect it from the drive, and connect it to my drive, rather than flipping up that black thing on the IPOD and removing the connector.  I&#8217;m looking online like a madman, and all tutorials rely on my new drive&#8217;s having its own ZIF.  That doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case with mine.  Did I miss the answer and/or does anyone know a link to a photo, if not a video, showing this?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone!</p>

			<p>5 minutes too early.  The ZIF disconnects from the drive in pretty much the same way as it disconnects from the logic board.  It flips up, 90 degrees.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture (middle one)</p>

			<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>Has anybody found out how to access the added memory yet?  I upgraded my 4G 20Gig to a 30Gig, but it only shows up as the original 16 or so Gig I had with my 20.  There were a few other postings with this problem.  Please let me know if you find out!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>So I have a 30GB 5th Gen Video, now that can only mean I have one hard drive</p>
<p>Toshiba MK3008GAL </p>
<p>OK, thats fine, but then that means there is NO possible upgrade for my model, as bigger hard drive are the 8mm kind..</p>
<p>Am I correct???</p>
<p>I need help, my current 30GB hard drive is faulty and need new one, just thought might as well get more space?!?!</p>

			<p>OK</p>
<p>After more research I have found out that I could use a Seagate ST760211DE in my 5th Gen 30GB, OR</p>
<p>I could get a thicker 8mm HDD and upgrade back plate and internal parts. </p>
<p>Just want to know if this is correct, I know it seems like a noob question but swapping HDD in such a small machine is obviously not an easy job, just dont want to make it harder. </p>
<p>Seeing as i dont want to mess about with back plates suppose i got either replace HDD or get Seagate ST760211DE.</p>
<p>Has anyone else done a Seagate ST760211DE and can confirm success?</p>

			<p>WOW Tabias that is a well good steal mate, good finding.</p>
<p>A 5mm 80GB HDD, that means no messing just straight swap with a Toshiba MK3008GAL 5th Gen Video.</p>
<p>IF you get a successful swap I will deff go for that to.</p>
<p>£150 works out just over £100, worth it for 80GB.</p>
<p>Will the battery in a 30GB 5G handle such a drive?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

			<p>Ben,</p>
<p>I have successfully installed the Seagate Lyrion 60gb drive in a 5G Video.  It works great and requires no thick back as the drive is 5mm like the 30gb it is replacing.  Unfortunately, the market for buying/finding the 60gb Lyrion is tough and the batch I received for upgrades were of poor quality.  I had one out of four fail.  I am considering doing the HS081HA for my 5G Video customer upgrades.  This drive is solid.  Good luck and enjoy.</p>

<p>You could also use this 80GB hdd for your ipod video, i am going to buy that one <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/NEW-Samsung-HS081HA-80GB-Hard-Drive-iPod-Classic-Zune_W0QQitemZ350157223634QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_AudioTVElectronics_PortableAudio_MP3Players?hash=item350157223634&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_trkparms=72%3A1683" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/NEW-Samsung-HS081HA-80GB-Hard-Drive-iPod-Classic-Zune_W0QQitemZ350157223634QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_AudioTVElectronics_PortableAudio_MP3Players?hash=item350157223634&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&amp;_trkparms=72%3A1683</a>|66%3A2|65%3A12|39%3A1|240%3A1318</p>
<p>It should be guaranteed to work without any problems. I dont think it is neccesary to change the battery, but you could buy a replacement at the same seller</p>

			<p>Edit: I compared the two drives, and it looks like the one Tobias links to, is faster &#8211; Faster rotation speed 3600 VS 4200 and more cache 2mb VS 8mb. If the MK8025 works, i would definately buy that instead.</p>

			<p>For the 5th and 5.5 gen Video iPod that are 30G model there is a Samsung Drive 120G hard drive that will work Model HS120JB/JM1.  It&#8217;s a spin point N2 but will require a larger back panel for it.  It will fit perfectly into the 60G and 80G.</p>
<p>For all models Video ipod a 100G Toshiba MK1011GAH hard drive will work-its 5mm </p>
<p>For Warner with the 6G Classic the 240GB Toshiba MK2431GAH drive with not work with the Classic, but will work with 5th and 5.5 Gen.   It&#8217;s 8mm and will will only work with the 30G model if you add the larger back panel </p>
<p>Since I prefer the 5mm, I don&#8217;t care about the thicker drive but thought I would pass that on to those that do.</p>

			<p>Hey</p>
<p>Thanks for reporting success on the 60GB, but like you said hard to find, so gone of that idea ATM.</p>
<p>I was looking at my friends new 80GB 6th Gen, and saw that its the same 5mm design as my 30GB 5th Gen. Therefore might go for that HDD. Some people say on the internet that this is NOT possible because 6th Gen HDD are only used for 6th Gen.</p>
<p>BUT surely you can put this drive&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idemigods.com/6th_Gen_iPod_Classic_80GB_Hard_Drive_MK8022GAA_p/80gbhrddrv_mk8022gaa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.idemigods.com/6th_Gen_iPod_Classic_80GB_Hard_Drive_MK8022GAA_p/80gbhrddrv_mk8022gaa.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8230;.into a 5th Gen Video. Best of all only around $120</p>

<p>I think Toshiba MK1011GAH is not 5mm. It is 8mm.<br />
Perhaps, The last letter &#8220;H&#8221; of &#8220;MKXXXXGAH&#8221; means High, that is 8mm.<br />
On the other hand, &#8220;L&#8221; means Low, that is 5mm.<br />
The largest model which can be installed into iPod 5.5G is MK8025GAL (and MK8022GAA) at this moment.<br />
MK8022GAA has a firmware specialized to iPod only, but MK8025GAL can be used not only iPod but also PC or other machine, I suppose.  </p>
<p>By the way, after I gave up installing MK1231GAL (120GB, 5mm) into my iPod 5.5G, I ordered MK2341GAL (240GB, 8mm) and back panel from Rapid Repair and waiting for shipping now.</p>

<p>Aww im sad to hear that.. i hoped you would get it to work in the end.. </p>
<p>On ebay, the MK8022GAA seems to be incompatible with the ipod video &#8220;Is compatible with 6th Gen Ipod Video Classic only. These drives are proprietary to Gen6 and will not function in any other product. They will not replace MK3008GAL or MK6008GAH. They only replace MK8022GAA&#8221; Where did you read, that it is compatible?</p>
<p>The MK8025GAL is a lot more expensive than the Samsung HS081HA 80GB. Do you think you can feel the difference in the speed? After all we are working with ipod with a small amount of RAM, so the hardware might limit the very fast harddrive to a speed similar to the HS081HA.</p>
<p>Please write back, when you find out if/how the MK2341GAL works.</p>

			<p>This weekend I installed the Samsung 80gb drive HS081HA<br />
into a 5G Video.  It replaced a 30gb drive as an upgrade.<br />
The install went without a hitch &#8211; I gave the drive a FAT32 format, installed it, iTunes recognized the iPOD as in recovery mode, restored, and tested by adding 1000 songs and cycling through them.  The great news about this drive is that it does not require a thick back as it is a 5mm drive thickness.</p>

			<p>Piejesu /Ben,  I&#8217;ve been working 74 hour weeks to help land business to help land sales in my company-sorry for not responding.  This is my first weekend off this year and I&#8217;m  celebrating it by sleeping most of the day.  To answer your question, you are correct MK1011GAH, sorry.  Also rapid repair has updated it&#8217;s website to help answer basic hard drive questions through their own trial and error.  <a href="http://www.rapidrepair.com/shop/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapidrepair.com/shop/index.html</a></p>

			<p>Why doesn&#8217;t the MK3006GAL work with 1g iPods?</p>
<p>Do we know that the MK4007GAL works on 1g iPods, or does it just fit?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m basically trying to figure out what the largest drive I can fit into a 1st gen 5gb and still have it function as well.  Please help if possible&#8230;</p>

			<p>Hi, all</p>
<p>Today I have received MK2431GAH from Rapid Repair, and installed it into my iPod 5.5G successfully.<br />
It works perfectly. The only problem (?) is it takes a lot of time to fill up the 240GB HDD with my music library.<br />
But, anyway, I am now very satisfied with my renewal iPod, because I become to carry out about half of my music library!</p>
<p>Feb 5, 2009 Ordered<br />
Feb 25,2009 Shipping Notification mail arrived<br />
Feb 28, 2009 HDD arrived by USPS International Priority Mail</p>

-iPod Linux doesent work anymore.. I dont know if i did something wrong this time when i installed it, im gonna try again soon<br />
-Rockbox also crashes, im gonna try a different installing method soon. </p>

			<p>I upgraded my hard drive, display shows a folder with an exclamation point.</p>
<p>When I put it into disk mode and plug it in, itunes recognizes that it needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>It goes through the &#8220;repair&#8221; cycle, then at the end I get an error message that says:</p>
<p>&#8220;The ipod could not be restored.  An unknown error has occurred (1429).</p>
<p>It sounds like the hard drive is clicking about every second as well during the repair process.</p>
<p>Disk Utility recognizes the size of the hard drive, any ideas on what to do?</p>
<p>This is a 1g iPod&#8230;.please help!</p>

			<p>We perform the upgrades frequently for the 5 and 5.5G iPODs, as well as, repairs for the same models, including all the other previous generations.  We also repair and upgrade the 6G Video.<br />
Using Compact Flash memory in the iPODs is another upgrade option we offer, however, the cost differential needs to be considered with this option.  Of course capacity is limited in todays CF market as well.  The single point of failure of the mechanical drive is removed with an increase in seek/read times and significantly less drain on the battery.  WE have had good success with the HS series drives in the iPODs, with similar observations as noted here by Johannes.</p>

			<p>I have a 5g 30GB that started getting the &#8220;Very Low Battery Please Wait&#8221;.  I opened it and disconnected power, got the apple and was able to get to disk mode.  From there it was exactly what sfglenrock had posted previously:<br />
&#8216;I then get the screen that says “connect to your computer, use itunes to restore. I plug it in, open itunes and it doesn’t recognize the ipod. The ipod now shows the “do not disconnect” message for a couple of minutes, then resets and goes back to a message that says “Please wait. Very low battery”. But it has been plugged in all day and when it is in disk mode, shows the battery charged.&#8217;</p>
<p>I tried setting the battery again, and checked all the connections.  Now when the HD is plugged in and I plug in the ipod it only says &#8220;Very Low Battery Please Wait&#8221; and I cant reset or go to disk mode or anything. When it is not plugged in, it does nothing (blank screen).<br />
Without the HD it actually shows the apple, then the sadface ipod thing.  <br />
Any thoughts Collin?  (I hope you&#8217;re still following this).</p>

<p>the question has been asked by other poeple before, but wasn&#8217;t really answered I think.</p>
<p>
Is it possible to fit a 240 gig drive in an iPod Classic 6G 160gig?</p>
<p>either this one:</p>

			<p>I have a 5th Gen 80GB iPod purchased 2 years ago.  The Toshiba drive is a MK8010GAH.  My problem is the iPod recharges ONLY on the car charger.  It is not recognized when plugged into either a PC or Mac and will not charge but it plays music and whatever else I have downloaded in the past.  Could it be something other than the hard drive?</p>

			<p>FYI&#8230; I didn&#8217;t recall reading this when I decided to break open my 5th Gen iPod 80GB with video.  I want to help others who work on similar systems to avoid problems.  In earlier iPod cases the directions indicated no locking points on the ends of the case.  On mine there are 4 release points on the right side of the case looking at the display and one on the top between the lock switch and the headphone plug.  It is easily broken if you are not careful in opening the case.</p>

			<p>Great Site! I&#8217;m having a little problem here. I have completed the swap and am having trouble getting it into Disk Mode. When I do get it to go into Disk Mode, I connect the iPod with iTunes open and it won&#8217;t recognize the iPod. So when I disconnect it and restart the iPod it just cycles through &#8220;sad face&#8221;, off, &#8220;apple logo&#8221; and back to &#8220;sad face&#8221;. Repeat. HELP!</p>

			<p>Hey guys! Excellent site! I was planning to upgrade my 5th gen U2 iPod Video 30gb and have a few questions I hope you experts can help me with.</p>
<p>1) Samsung HS081HA is the largest HD that will fit without needing a bigger back? </p>
<p>2) where can I get the foam padding and rubber braces for the HD?</p>
<p>3)Will I need a new battery if I upgrade? If so any recommendations?</p>
<p>Thank you! Cheers!</p>

			<p>I have a 4th gen iPod that I replaced the battery on a while ago.  The replacement battery was slightly thicker than the original which was not a problem but when I went to install a new 60GB MK6006GAH which was thicker than the original HDD it was too much.  I can barely get the clamshell closed and when I do it puts too much pressure on the back of the trackwheel and I can&#8217;t push any buttons. It works fine if it is not quite closed all the way.  Do you have any tips on where to get a thinner battery? BTW I got the thick battery from iPod Battery Depot.  Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

			<p>I figured out the problem.  I have a 20gb 4G iPod that is thinner than the 40gb model.  It looks like I can pick up a larger back to make this work.  You may want to note in your table that the 8mm drives don&#8217;t fit in the 4g 20gb ipod.</p>

			<p>I have a 60gb ipod photo. The HD needs to be replaced. Now I remember reading somewhere (nope.. I don&#8217;t remember where, sorry) that 60gb is the maximum possible size for a 4g/photo. Yet in the compatibilty chart above, a 80gb is also listed. Which is good news. The obvious question arises:</p>
<p>- Why an even larger drive (say 120 or 160 gb) won&#8217;t work. Is this an iPod soft/firmware restriction? Or is 80gb simply the largest available 1.8 inch IDE drive?</p>

			<p>Hey guys! I would like to report a succesful swap of a SAMSUNG HS081HB 80g 5mm HD into my 5th Gen 30g U2 edition video iPod!</p>
<p>The onlt issues encountered:<br />
1) New HD did not have the black ribbon catch<br />
2) One side of the HD did not have a metal covering</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know if this was normal tho.</p>
<p>Anyway was just wondering if it&#8217;s normal for the drive to have 74g available when I restored it?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

			<p>I saw some people here  been running 80gb drive in their slim 30gb 5g ipod without any problems. I&#8217;ve attempted the same mod with Samsung HS081HA drive and although everything works (itunes and even rmaniac&#8217;s version of Rockbox), I get simply shockingly bad file transfer rates in both ipod OSs. My Windows Commander reports 500kb/s transfer rates for large FLAC files, while smaller MP3s are transfered at about 300 kb/s!</p>
<p>Same ipod with original 30gb drive was getting above 12 MB/sec!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just wondering what is your experience in this regard? What kind of transfer rates are you achieving?</p>

<p>Hi, i exchanged my ipod video 30gb with the same samsung harddrive as you and im experiencing the same problems as you are. Sync with iTunes is unbelieveable slow (probably about 300-500kbps like you said) and ipod linux or rockbox doensnt even work any more. I would really like to know how you got rockbox working, i couldnt get my installation to work.. Im pretty sure it is possible to get ipod linux to work if you use this guide: <a href="http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Manual_Installation" rel="nofollow">http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Manual_Installation</a></p>
<p>@Koolaidkid Yep its normal (most of it, cant remember how the hdd looked like when i got it). And the max capacity was about 74 gb when its recovered.</p>

<p>OK, its &#8220;good&#8221; to know I&#8217;m not the only one with such problems &#8211; I was about to blame the connector, motherboard or drive itself. But two of us with same problem means its likely a firmware issue.</p>
<p>FURTHER, I&#8217;ve made some progress and improved its transfer speed to 5-10 MB/s for about 1-2 sec and then stable 1MB/s thereafter! Not super great, but at least more tolerable (hopefully just for now:)<br />
Go to device manager&gt;disk drives&gt;right click &#8220;apple ipod&#8221;&gt;policies&gt; and check &#8220;maximum performance&#8221; and &#8220;use caching&#8221;.</p>
<p>Actually the &#8220;caching&#8221; option will grey out after after that, but transfer improves to what I was saying above.</p>
<p>Installing rockbox: check out this thread, as normal install does not work. Use the build by Rmaniac <a href="http://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=20960.0" rel="nofollow">http://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=20960.0</a></p>

			<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Just have read of an identical problem with transfer speeds (Samsung 80GB+5g Ipod) on some russian ipod forums- it is definitely not a cable/hardware problem!</p>
<p>The guy there has actually found a complete solution- reformat ipod on Mac and everything started to work perfectly. I dont use Macs unfortunately:(</p>

<p>Hmm, 3 of my last answeres were deleted&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some developments on the ipod 5g + Samsung 80gb issue &#8211; transfer rates improved<br />
But, now its really wierd- with &#8220;optimize for performance&#8221; and &#8220;disc caching&#8221;  selected (Go to device manager&gt;disk drives&gt;right click “apple ipod”&gt;PROPERTIES&gt;policies&gt; and check “maximum performance” and “use caching”)the disc caching option deselects itslef and goes gray&#8230; The transfer speeds are then 5-10MB/s for the INITIAL 1-3 seconds of ALL subsequent file transfers and then drop to consistent 1mb/s(with occasional speed up 3/4 way through the transfer). So basically I can transfer 1-2 songs at a time at full speed, but if I transfer more files in one go &#8211; speed drops&#8230;</p>
<p>To install Rockbox use the build from this thread <a href="http://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=20960.0" rel="nofollow">http://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=20960.0</a></p>

			<p>I am trying to sort out exactly what the problem with my iPod 5G 80GB. It died with the sad ipod icon and I assumed it was a crashed HD. I was occasionally getting the &#8220;battery very low&#8221; message as well (only when on a charger), as some have mentioned above. I bought a &#8220;refurbished&#8221; Toshiba MK8010GAH 80GB &#8211; to replace the HD, but I cannot get my mac to recognize the iPod at all. I get it into drive mode but neither iTunes or DiskUtiity recognize. The iPod says &#8220;Do not Disconnect&#8221;, but eventually restarts. I even ordered a new iPod ZIF cable (had some problems with the original!) and all the connections look good. Can anyone think of any tricks I am missing?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the link, that version of rockbox works perfectly! I also tried changing that setting in windows, and AFAIK the speed is improved abit (Like you say, about 1-2MB/S).. Im not sure about this, i havent got any program to test the speed. What program do you use to measure the transfer speed?</p>
<p>I also read something on the rockbox site, that you could improve the transfer speed by installing some patch to the rockbox software.. i dont know if this will help though..</p>
<p>Btw. do you also experience that iTunes freezes when you connect the ipod? My iTunes program do this when the cache setting is enabled and the iPod is connected, it never did this before. The stange thing is that itunes keep playing the music, the window is just frozen.</p>

<p>I dont really use itunes anymore- my ipod is really an &#8220;imod&#8221; and I try to transfer everything in FLAC. But on several occasions that I did use itunes I didn&#8217;t experience any lockups whatsoever. In that regard everything was normal.</p>
<p>I also found that i need to reboot the IPOD into itunes (from rockbox), otherwise speeds drop to 300kb/s again. when ipod is in itunes mode i still use it as a disk drive to &#8220;drag&#8217;n'drop&#8221; files, but its much quicker this way when compared to it in rockbox mode&#8230;</p>
<p>Let us know if you find any fresh info on improving the transfers. (Did you read my post where I said that ipod 30gb turned into Samsung 80gb transfers perfectly fast when formated by Mac and used on Mac? Really weird that:(  )</p>

			<p>Hello dear fellows in hard drive changing crime!</p>
<p>I read this thread with great interest and do have a few questions. My hard drive on my 5.5G 30GB iPod died and I decided to change it myself and upgrade it to 80GB. I already opened it to see if everything is as I read/saw here and elsewhere on the web before I order any hard drive and spend the money. Glad that I did open it, because it seems my iPod is a &#8220;freak of nature&#8221; as it originally ran with a Hitachi HTC426030G5CE00 hard drive as opposed to a Toshiba as I expected. (Also the battery is black with white writing on it instead of plain blue.) Now I&#8217;m a little worried about the ZIF connection / compatibility&#8230; But as the Hitachi hard drive uses a ZIF 40 I should be able to replace it with a Samsung HS081HA, right? Is tehere anything else I need to consider? I plan on getting one of those. But then I hear that the transfer &#8220;speed&#8221; is beyond anything fast? Is that the case with every model? I run my iPod with iTunes/Win. Would you recommend another hard drive then? </p>
<p>Thank you for helping out!</p>

<p>Oh i see.. I can understand why, iTunes suck so badly, i wish i could use some other program instead, but then all playlist and ratings and album arts need to be redone and i really dont want to do all that again.. </p>
<p>I just recovered my ipod and enabled cache and now the transfer rate is very very fast (50MBps+), abit like you wrote, where its very fast in the beginning and then drops to about 12-13 MBps (Im not completely sure if these numbers are exact because this was just what vista wrote when i transfered a CD image to the ipod) The problem is that itunes locks completely up when i transfer the music to it, but i think it might be because im using a 32bit iTunes atm. I will try to install the newer 64bit version ASAP and see if this helps.</p>
<p>Yeah i did read that &#8211; , but the problem is that i have no Mac myself. Maybe you could try formatting it with HFS+ and use a program like xplay3 to sync to the mac ipod under windows. I cant try this myself because xplay3 doesnt work with Vista 64bit :(</p>

I believe all ipod 5gen zif connectors are the same, so you should be able to install a new HD- Samsung or not is up to you:) Can you live with 1mb/sec transfers? For me- its tolerable (300kb/s &#8211; is not tolerable, 1mb is ok)</p>
<p>@<a href=#comment-146779>KillerBee230</a><br />
I am using windows XP, no need to deal with Vista problems on top of already existing problems with ipod+Sammy;)I guess there is some instability in that ipod+samsung combo and XP deals with it by reducing transfer rate, where as Vista simply locks up&#8230;</p>
<p>I dont quite understand what you mean by &#8220;itunes locks up when I transfer cd image to ipod&#8221;&#8230;  Itunes as ipod software? Or the PC itunes locks up? Or both?<br />
What happens when your ipod is booted into itunes (not rockbox) and you use it as disk drive (ie as external hard drive and transfer some big files to it)? Does something lock up then as well?</p>
<p>Does PC itunes lock up when you transfer songs through itunes onto your ipod?</p>
<p>As for HFS+ &#8211; I&#8217;ve grown to accept the 1mb/s transfers, plus I&#8217;d like to have ability to (slowly) transfer music at friends houses and stuff. I dont want to be limited to just one pc with installed xplay3 on it&#8230;</p>

<p>Yeah you are probably right about that one, vista often locks up when you transfer files, its also unbelieveable slow compared to Win XP.</p>
<p>Oh and im sorry I think you misunderstood me abit. I meant when you transfer files to the ipod though windows it transfer the files VERY fast (about 20+ MBps or so) but when it have transfered the file about 99%, windows vista locks up completely and I have to quit all the related jobs. So yes, when I use it as an external hard drive it transfers very very fast and then locks up in the end.</p>
<p>Itunes also locks up when you connect the ipod and the music sync begins. The only way I can avoid this is my unplugging the ipod again or by disable the cache. So yes, PC itunes lock up when you transfer songs that way. Still, im not sure if this is because im using the 32bit itunes, itunes might not freeze when you are using the 64bit one. THe only reason that i havent changed is that i cant use a special black theme for itunes, and this only works with 32 bit iTunes :)</p>
<p>And yeah i can see that is a problem, its not good to be limited to just one PC when you can use your ipod like that, im just used to not being able to copy the music directly to and from the ipod just like any other mp3 player, so i totally forgot about this. I would really like this feature, i might change to rockbox only when i get the time to rearrange all my music.. so what program do you use then if you dont use itunes?</p>

			<p>What is the largest available HD that a 3G iPod that started its life as a 15 Gb unit can currently take?  The HD in mine has finally died (it keeps freezing up when I try to sync it, even though it still plays flawlessly).  I love the 3G&#8217;s controls and have averaged 4-6 hours of use on it every day since I got it 5.5 years ago.</p>
<p>Thanx!</p>

			<p>My 80g (i think its a 5th gen. video) started completely dumping all music when it got about 60 songs loaded. I was told that the hard drive was bad so I disassembled the ipod , retrieved the hard drive model# mk8022gaa and decided to try and upgrade it to 160gb hard drive m# mk1626gcb&#8230; the connectors are different so I bought a connector for the 160gb 6th gen and it all plugs in now but the screen comes up with a red x in a circle when turned on . I tried to reconfigure it with the ipod diag. commands, and I checked to see if the ipod even recognized the hard drive or its capacity. the ipod screen says &#8220;open device&#8221; and at the bottom of the screen it says &#8220;error! diag halt&#8221;. Ok yes it is open, I didnt want to have to open the case again.  Can any one please help me???? Is what im doing even possible to work? Im to the point that I thinking about ordering a 6th gen logic board&#8230;</p>

			<p>Hello, </p>
<p>great site here! My iPod Video 5.5Gen 80GB (bought in March 2007) needs a new HD. The original HD is Toshiba MK8010GAH. I&#8217;d like to increase space but actually don&#8217;t need 240GB and thus this one is too expensive (~285USD + shipping to Germany).</p>
<p>My question is whether or not the following HDs are compatible to my iPod:<br />
Toshiba MK1214GAH (120GB) ~110€<br />
Toshiba MK1629GSG (160GB) ~140€</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help</p>

			<p>DEAR LORD!!!!<br />
Why would this site actually RECOMMEND using a razor blade on the 5G/5.5G iPods?!<br />
Okay, here is the reason you should NEVER use a razor blade for this purpose:<br />
There are ribbon cables that are close to the side of of your beloved iPod Video, not to mention the soft acrylic top case AND all those little blood vessels in your fingers!!!</p>
<p>SOLUTION:<br />
Find yourself a local music supply shop (Guitar Center/ Daddy&#8217;s Junky Music / or the local mom n&#8217; pop shop around the corner) and get yourself a few Dunlop &#8220;Tortex&#8221; pics&#8230; these are smooth nylon pics that will not break but have incredible flexibility. They are color coded by thickness, the orange are about .63 mm and are quite ideal for this purpose. they will run you about twenty five cents each.</p>
<p>I would stay far away from using the Fender style pics&#8230; they have a tendency to break too easily, leaving little pieces of guitar pics floating around in your iPod until you finally get it open&#8230; though if you happen to have a couple hundred of those laying around, knock yourself out&#8230; it&#8217;s bound to work eventually.</p>

			<p>Oh, the guitar pick technique I use also does away with the black stick tool as well. all you need is two of them and you have everything you need to get in to the ipod&#8230; and it works on all models of the iPod up until the &#8220;Classic&#8221; model. that&#8217;s another bag of headaches in it&#8217;s self.</p>

			<p>Just completed an upgrade of the slim version (30GB iPOD Video) to Samsung&#8217;s 80GB HS082HB.  Ran in to a hitch and it took a LOT longer than I expected but it&#8217;s all up and running now.</p>
<p>Problem was that, unlike everything mentioned so far, my iPOD came stock with a Hitachi drive, not a Toshiba.  While the Toshiba (and my new Samsung) use a ZIF HDD connector ribbon that is .25mm thick, the Hitachi uses one that has a thicker .35mm end going in to the HDD.  When I found that this connector simply would not fit into my Samsung HS082HB I did a little research and came up with exactly one online store (<a href="http://store.ifixipodsfast.com/" rel="nofollow">http://store.ifixipodsfast.com/</a>) which seemed aware of the difference and would sell you either the thick (hitachi) or thin (samsung) type.</p>
<p>No way I wanted to wait several more days, however, so I spent an hour or two with an exacto knife shaving that .35mm down to .25mm.  It wasn&#8217;t easy (and didn&#8217;t work the first try) but eventually I got it and now I&#8217;m listening to tunes of my 80GB with upgraded 580mAh battery.</p>
<p>If anyone is still updating the main article, it might be worth mentioning the Hitachi-style .35mm thick ZIF connector.</p>

			<p>I saw this question posted a few times without a response &#8211; and now it&#8217;s my turn to ask&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a 4th gen 40gb iPod that needs a new HD. What is the max size that will work with this model, and that someone has actually installed? </p>
<p>I called Rapid Response and they state that 60gb is the max. This here site has a 80gb HD listed as compatible. Anyone try it out yet? </p>
<p>I compared the datasheets for the 40gb Toshiba MK4006GAH &amp; 60gb Toshiba MK6006GAH and electrically they are compatible. The 80gb Toshiba MK8007GAH listed on this site states it will work for this model, however, it has a higher start power consumption rating of 1.8 watts vs 1.2 watts of the other models I mentioned. Is the 1.8 watt rating a deal killer for using the bigger drives on this model? </p>
<p>And, will the logic board and/or iTunes recognize the higher capacity if I install something bigger than the original 40gb on this model?   &#8212;   Thanks!!</p>

			<p>I can report that it is in my experience impossible to connect a samsung hs161jq 160gb drive to a 5.5g 80gig ipod. it fits inside the ipod, and if you obtain the new zif ribbon connector with the smaller hd size connector, the hd will appear to connect correctly with the board, and will even spin up and enter disc mode, however, some driver incompatibility in the ipod must be interfering with the drive&#8217;s proper operation, as disc mode is aborted after some time. when the terminal output from the attempted mounting of the new drive is viewed, some promise is showed, even the size of the drive is correctly reported, but some errors require the drive to be shut down. it can not be formatted.</p>

			<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have a little problem here, I just bought a 80gb Toshiba MK8010GAH for my ipod 30gb gen 5. I&#8217;m not able to restore it or format it. Everytime I&#8217;m trying to restore it with Itunes I get a 1416 error code. Is there a fix to my problem??</p>

			<p>Thanks for all the great info on upgrading.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a 20GB 4th gen iPod that had a bad hard drive (#MK2006GAL) as it was giving me the folder icon and would not be recognized by iTunes even in disk mode.  Hard drive was also clicking when trying to spin.  After reading your comments, I bought a 30GB hard drive (#MK3006GAL) to replace it.  Everything went fine.  I booted it up, reset it, put it in disk mode, connected to my computer, and iTunes recognized it as a corrupted iPod that needed to be restored.  I canceled out of those messages and clicked the restore button in iTunes.  It downloaded the software and installed it.  </p>
<p>The problem is that after installation, the iPod gives me the electrical outlet with the Apple charger icon.  I plugged it into the wall outlet, but there was no change as far as the icon.  When I tried disconnecting and resetting the iPod, I would just get the same icon.  When I tried resetting with iPod plugged into the wall outlet, I get the battery with exclamation point icon.  I also tried connecting it the computer again, but neither the computer nor iTunes will recognize it.  I left it plugged into the wall overnight, but no change.</p>
<p>I thought it might be the battery, so I opened it back up, put the old broken 20GB hard drive back in to try charging it, and it showed that it was fully charged.</p>
<p>The only thing that I could think of was that my wall charger is not the factory Apple charger.  It&#8217;s one I bought off eBay, but it charged this iPod just fine before I swapped the hard drive.  I&#8217;m not sure what the problem is, but thought I would post here to see if anyone else had a similar problem.  </p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

			<p>Hi:</p>
<p>This may have been answered already, but I have a 5th gen vido and the HD is bad.  I want to replace it with another 30 or 60 HD, or can one go bigger, if so is there a reference page that lists the different HD that are the correct dimenstions for the 5th gen video. The Drive in it is Thoshiba MK30008GAL.</p>

			<p>My 4G finally died on me and I bought the appropriate tools and opened the iPod.</p>
<p>My original drive was the MK4004GAH -<br />
Is the MK8007GAH? 80 50 Pins 8 the largest that I can upgrade to now?Are the voltage levels suitable for it? I can&#8217;t see any obvious differences.</p>
<p>My other question is &#8211; is there any other 1.8&#8243; 50 pins 8mm drive with this voltage that is higher &#8211; say around 100 to 160 GB that I can use to upgrade?</p>

			<p>Hi,<br />
in the picture <br />
<a href="http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/zif_drive.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.command-tab.com/images/ipods/zif_drive.jpg</a><br />
it looks like you have a connector with the larger zif (perhaps 40pos) and the smaller on the other side (20?). <br />
I am replacing a SDD in an hp mini which has the ribbon connector, the new HD is a zif but it is the smaller size. Does anyone know if an adapter or a ribbon connector with both sizes exists? And if so, where I can find one.<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

			<p>Does anybody know why my 60 GB iPod 5G would inexplicably start reporting its drive size as 16 GB (as reported by the iPod&#8217;s diagnostic mode)?  I physically verified that the drive is a Toshiba MK6008GAH, but explaining the change of heart is beyond me.</p>

			<p>-299 Asked a similar question</p>
<p>I have a 5th Gen Video 60GB, 240GB would be sweet, too expensive. Would one of the 160GB drives work? Seems like they use different interfaces or connectors, I can&#8217;t seen to find the exact info I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p>I know the: Toshiba MK8031GAL,MK8031GAL,MK2431GAH drives work.</p>
<p>Do these: Samsung HS161JB, Toshiba MK1626GCB work???</p>

			<p>i&#8217;ve learned a lot by snooping around on sites like this so thought i would pass on a recent discovery of mine. After replacing the Logic board in my 5th G Video 60G for an overheating problem when charging that problem was fixed but got the sad face and bad HDD noises,(Click of Death). HDD had been working fine before Logic Board replacement. Slapped it a couple of times and got it into Disk mode and restored it. It lasted about 3 hours then crapped out again. Sad face etc. Played around with the HDD flex connector at the Logic Board 5 different times. Each time I could get it working intermittently. I finally got it perfectly aligned and it&#8217;s been working fine for 3 days now. I believe the lesson may be that there are 50 circuits being routed through about a 1/2 inch wide strip at the board end and getting it aligned with the board connector is critical. This could really be the source of many problems reporedly fixed by slapping or banging the IPod. These connections are so close together it would be easy to make intermittent connections that eventually open again. To prevent this problem in the future I would recommend disconnecting the flex from the HDD itself rather than from the Logic Board. There was lots of sticky to keep the Logic Board end of the flex in place that I had to disturb to get it disconnected. The flex at the HDD is much wider than it is at the board and should be much easier to align. Hope this helps someone.</p>

			<p>In August, I got a car stereo converter that plugs into the CD-changer hole on the back of my existing car stereo.  A cable comes out under the dash and connects to my iPod.  When connected, the CD controls (skip, back, FF, REW) control the iPod.  I have two iPods &#8211; one &#8220;white&#8221;, 4th generation clickwheel, 3+ years old; the other &#8220;black&#8221;, 5th generation late 2006, 18 months old.  Both connected to the dock and worked okay for a brief period &#8211; maybe 2-3 weeks &#8211; then both suddenly died within a week of each other.  I assumed it a stroke of poorly-timed bad luck, researched, found this awesome site and figured it was the hard drive, then ordered replacement hard drives for each and installed.  </p>
<p>Once the new drive was in, White gave me some headache (wasn&#8217;t being recognized by iTunes), but eventually (not sure how) got working. Black (the younger of the 2) never got working.  Hitting Menu results in nothing &#8211; blank screen.  I figured it was bad timing / not the new car stereo adapter, and was grateful to have *one* working iPod back in my life.</p>
<p>A month later, White returned to its old habits.  Freezes during play, requires reboot, then comes up fine &#8211; but when I hit &#8220;Menu,&#8221; all music appears to be gone.  When I hook it up to the machine it was formerly synced with, it mounts to the desktop as a hard drive but doesn&#8217;t show up in iTunes for sync.  So I connect it to another mac and it comes up in iTunes, which tells me it &#8220;appears to be corrupted&#8221; and prompts me to restore.  I do so, the machine thinks, then the dreaded error returns:  &#8220;The iPod could not be restored.  An unknown error occurred (1433).&#8221;</p>
<p>What gives???  </p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>- What&#8217;s the likelihood that this problem has nothing to do with the car stereo adapter?  It seems to me that the car stereo is just sending *commands* &#8211; no real *data* (which would be required to correct the iPod).  Plus, too, it seems corruption would happen immediately after connection if it was the car stereo adapter &#8211; not after several weeks of working?</p>
<p>- Are there any common mistakes during install of the newer drives?  Any idea why Black won&#8217;t even come on since the new drive went in?  I remember the cable that connected the drive was much more difficult to remove/insert than the one going into the older drive.  Could I have damaged it getting it in and out?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I&#8217;ve spent so much money nad time trying to fix the old ones that to have to buy a whole new iPod now is really going to chap my ass&#8230;</p>

			<p>Hi Fernando,  Apple has tried to prevent anything greater than a 80G HD to work in it&#8217;s 5.5 Gen Video Ipod. The 120G is out because it&#8217;s still selling with the classic.  If you want to upgrade to a 240 GB, you can by adding a deeper 8mm backplate and Samsung hard drive.  Toshiba also makes on MK2431GAH.  Make sure you get the right one&#8230;The hard drive is a little slower, but it works according to Rapid Repair. There is a way to put the Classic software on and have it work with the hardware you have, but Apple does not permit people to put it on the internet.</p>

			<p>I have an iPod photo 4th Gen with a 60 GB hard drive. The logic board went out. I bought an iPod photo 4th Gen (used) on eBay to get the logic board. The replacement logic board came from an iPod with a 30 GB hard drive, mine is 60 GB, but I thought the difference was only the hard drive, the logic board would not matter.</p>
<p>However, with the replacement logic board installed, and my 60 GB hard drive, the iPod only recognizes 30 GB of hard drive space. My hard drive space was cut in half!</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think the logic board would make a difference, but apparently it does. Technically, I upgraded a larger hard drive, (according to the logic board) but the logic board won&#8217;t recognize it.</p>
<p>What can I do to get the logic board to recognize all 60 GB of hard drive space? I hope I don&#8217;t actually need a different logic board&#8230;that would suck.</p>
<p>Either there is a setting I am missing, or a step I didn&#8217;t do, or whatever. If I am really limited to ONLY 30 GB due to the logic board, then how can a whole web page be dedicated to upgrading to a larger hard drive? What am I missing?</p>
<p>Love to get a solution soon&#8230;<br />

			<p>My son has a 30 gig 5g (model A1136). He said the drive is clicking. He bought a new one. I thought I would fix this old one. I see you listed in March of 08 that a 60 gig Seagate drive would fit. (Seagate ST760211DE 60 GB 5mm drive). Now in 2010 is there a larger capacity 1.8&#8243; 5mm drive with the proper connector that will fit? I haven&#8217;t opened it up yet but I assume it&#8217;s a zif. Have I asked the right questions? What are my options? I feel comfortable taking this apart as I have torn apart numerous laptops.</p>

			<p>Now there seems to be a thin 80gb hard drive available, that can be a straight swap for a 30gb drive.<br />
Samsung HS081HA 80GB hardrive from iPod Classic.</p>
<p>BUT I have heard that some of the bigger drives are NOT compatible with SOME logic boards from the earlier 5G series.  </p>
<p>So does anyone know about this? and if so how do you identify a logic board that can accept a bigger hard drvie from those that can&#8217;t?</p>

			<p>I bought an original ipod hard drive. The one meant for my model. I went through the necessary steps you said. But when I plug the ipod into my computer after disk mode is started it says I need to connect using firewire. So I connect using firewire but then nothing happens at all and the computer doesn&#8217;t recognize it?</p>

			<p>@justin &#8211; The iPod Touch doesn&#8217;t have a hard drive.  Those have flash based storage.</p>
<p>@carlo &#8211; The HS030GA is 5mm thick, in order to upgrade to the MK1011GAH you&#8217;d need to purchase a larger back panel to accommodate the thicker hard drive.</p>

			<p>My age old 40 Gb iPod 3G&#8217;s HDD died an honorable death after a long life. I&#8217;m looking a replacement options. I&#8217;ve ruled out going to flash, as tempting as that sounds. I&#8217;d like to increase the capacity. I&#8217;m looking a going to 80 Gb. The options I&#8217;m considering are an MK8007GAH, which looks like it would be a simple swap, or a MK8009GAH with a ZIF to ATA adapter (<a href="http://snipurl.com/ulkre" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/ulkre</a>   [www_amazon_com]). The 8007 cost abou $225 (!!!). The 8009 is about $75 and the adapter is about $25.</p>
<p>My question is can I fit the 8009 + adapter into my iPod 3G? The length og the 8007 is 3.1 in and the 8009 is 2.8 in. I&#8217;m not sure how much space the adapter takes up. Thoughts? THANKS!</p>

			<p>I tried to upgrade my 20gb 4th gen ipod&#8217;s HD with a Toshiba MK8025GAL w/ZIF. I bought a ZIF to IDE micro converter <a href="http://www.uxsight.com/product/28035/zif-micro-ide-hdd-adapter-converter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uxsight.com/product/28035/zif-micro-ide-hdd-adapter-converter.html</a> It was a little tight but everything fit. I can&#8217;t get it to go into either reset or disc mode. Itunes doesn&#8217;t recognize it. It keeps cycling apple logo, blank screen, then unhappy face and finally the charging logo. It will keep doing this until I disconnect it. Does anyone have any ideas as to what I might be doing wrong. The 2 parts are new and I tested the HD and it works fine plugged into my desktop via USB. Thank you</p>

			<p>Ok&#8230; I got an MK8007GAH off eBay for $100. It fit just fine as replacement for the original 40Gb in my 3G, but I can&#8217;t get to work properly. It goes into a reset loop with the !File icon. I connect it to my Mac via USB. iTunes recognizes it as an unformatted iPod and asks to restore or update. If I restore, it says I need to connect via Firewire. iTunes doesn&#8217;t see it via FW. If I update, it goes through the process and then tells me to unplug it connect it to the charger to complete the update. I let it charge, but it still goes through the reset cycle. If I connect to the USB post, iTunes see it as an unformatted iPod again.</p>
<p>I managed to format the drive on an XP machine via USB in NTFS. One comment early in this thread got me looking at the spec sheets for the original 4004 hdd and my new 8007. The start up wattage increased from 1.3w to 1.8w. I&#8217;m thinking my iPod can&#8217;t spin up the 8007. The battery is getting old. I just replaced it with a NOS IP3 battery I picked up before CompUSA closed. After it has a full charge, I&#8217;ll give it another go. I wonder if an other, higher capacity battery would help?</p>
<p>The last shot will be to try to interface it directly with the Mac with an ATA6 adapter/cable or external case, just to make sure the drive is not a dud.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work, I might look into a CF or SSD solution&#8230;</p>

			<p>I connected two batteries in parallel, thinking that might provide the power to spin up the MK8007GAH disk. It was only a little better and I&#8217;m not sure the extra battery was the reason.</p>
<p>I was actually able to format it with my Mac as Journaled HFS+. But It still clicks when connected to the FW port, and still won&#8217;t allow a Restore if connected to the USB port. Updating seems to be the same: Connected to the USB, it goes through the update, then tells me hook it to the external power supply to complete the upgrade. After I do that then plug it back to the USB port, iTunes updates it again&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for an adapter to connect the disk by itself direct to the Mac. Then I can make sure the disk is good, which I strongly suspect it is. I hope I have an easier time formatting it, then I reinstall it in the iPod. </p>
<p>I also have a CF to 50 pin ATA adapter so I can go the FlashPod route. I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll use an SD card with a SD to CF adapter. I&#8217;ve got a couple 8g SDHC cards around.</p>
<p>Maybe down the road I can find/afford a CF or SD card that has <br />
comparable capacity as my iPod&#8230;</p>
<p>If anyone has been through this and has any ideas, I&#8217;d love to hear about it!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

			<p>Hi,<br />
I recently bought a 1G iPod, the iPod in which the wheel actually turns, on an auction website without a hard drive. I subsequently bought a Toshiba MK2004GAL after reading this article. I put the hard drive into the iPod and my problem now is that I cannot get the HD formatted correctly. When the iPod is forced into disk mode it is recognized by iTunes, but gives an error 1429 when finished formatting. According to Apple this error is caused by too many USB devices plugged in while formatting. However, I tried the same process with only the keyboard and mouse plugged in for the same result. I just need some advice on formatting the new hard drive to work with the iPod. Thanks in advance.</p>

			<p>i have a 80 gig ipod 5G that has a red x on it when you try and turn it on, and rebooting and restoring does nothing. i ran the diagnostics and got a fail on the HDD SPEC saying [can't open device] ERROR! diag halt. if this is the hard drive that is broken, could i just buy a new had drive and it will work again?? and if yes, what type do you recommend, i only want something over 10gig and under 80gig. thanks.</p>

			<p>The disk failed in my white, 20GB iPod. I think it&#8217;s a 4th generation model. Anyway, I found that a wood chisel (3/4 inch blade width) worked very well for opening the case. The chisel is sharp enough to penetrate between the case parts but also stiff enough such that you can twist it and get sufficient torque to get the case to pop open. I started on the left side bottom and it opened up very easily. I had it open in about 30 seconds. I hope this is helpful to others.</p>

			<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Great insight to how the Ipods work.</p>
<p>I have managed to upgrade my Original 5GB Hard Drive iPod to a 10Gb Hard Drive and was wondering if there are any larger hard drives out there can be fitted into the Original iPod please?</p>

			<p>My 4th gen 40Gb HDD died a death after a complete moron dropped it for me, and I&#8217;ve since used the information above to upgrade to a 60Gb HDD. It works just fine as a replacement, but I can&#8217;t use any more of the drive than I could with the original.<br />
I&#8217;ve read the ENTIRE page, and tried many of the suggestions included but I&#8217;ve had no success.<br />
Any ideas would be great.<br />
Thanks</p>

			<p>You guessed it, the one thing I didn&#8217;t try was patience. I&#8217;ve managed to get it to recognise the WHOLE of my new drive now. Thanks to everyone whose written on this page, it was all very helpful!!</p>
