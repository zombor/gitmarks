<H1>Flag as a symbol of language - stupidity or insult?</H1>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Very often flags are used as symbols of languages, on the Web
and elsewhere. For instance, a Web page might contain
an "English flag" which acts as a link to an English version
of a document (which itself is in another language).
It is usually bad practice to use images as anchors of
<a href="www/links.html"
title="Links Want To Be Links"
>links</a>,
but this document concentrates on the theme why flags are
particularly unsuitable anchors.
<p>
In a perfect world, there would be no need for explicit links
to versions of a document in different languages.
Even in this
imperfect world, the Web might evolve so that a server and
a user agent smoothly select a version according to language preferences
which the user has given when configuring the browser.
(There are methods for such negotation in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/">HTTP protocol</a>,
but they are rarely used in practice so far.
See <cite><a href="multi/index-en.htm">Techniques for multilingual Web
sites</a></cite>. This should not be confused with the misguided
"forced redirection" e.g. by Google, which uses undisclosed
heuristics to send the user to a page in a particular language.)</p>

<h2>Why flags are used as symbols of languages?</h2>

<p>Probably the most common motivation for using a flag as a language
symbol is that it is expected to
<strong>catch the eye</strong>
better than
text does.
<p>
I'm not arguing against that expectation, and I'm
not preaching against eye-catching images in general; see my article
<a href="images.html"><cite>How to use images in communication
in general and on the Web in particular</cite></a>.
I'm not even going to discuss the question whether it makes sense
to draw every reader's attention to a flag.
(Why should I care about a link to a German version in a document
written in a language which I know quite well, especially if I don't
know German?)
But I will present arguments which speak against flags as
language symbols much stronger than any 
arguments about
eye-catching
or esthetics can speak in favor of it.

<h2>The basic argument: what a flag really stands for</h2>

<p>Fundamentally, a flag is a symbol of a <strong>country</strong>.
(It could also be a symbol of an administrative area or a society
or organization or movement, but such flags are not used as symbols
of languages, with rare exceptions like
<a title="Multilingual info site about Esperanto"
href="http://www.esperanto.net">Esperanto</a>.)
<p>
Naturally one could use a flag a symbol for the country e.g.
in a list of links to information related to various countries.
Whether it is wise to do so depends on the context. Typically
people know names of countries better than their flags, so usually
a flag isn't such a great symbol communicatively.
What we discuss here is the use of flags for <em>languages</em>,
and such usage is plain wrong.
<p>
There is no one-to-one mapping between countries and languages.
Even in the rare cases where the
native speakers of a language and
the citizens of a country are almost identical groups, there is no
reason to
<strong>bind</strong> the country and the language strictly together.
<p>
<img src="po.gif" alt="[Flag of Portugal]" align=right>
Why should, for example, a Brasilian select the flag of Portugal
to select his native language?
It's quite possible that a Brasilian does not even <em>know</em>
the flag of Portugal.
<p>
<img src="f-se.gif" alt="[Flag of Sweden]" align=right>
Why should a Finn select the symbol of
Sweden in order to read some material in his native language if
it happens to be Swedish?
Such use of flags could be taken as an insult, since
loyalty to a flag is loyalty to the country that it symbolizes. 
And in practical terms, the flag of Sweden on a Web page of
an organization in Finland would <em>most logically</em> refer
to related pages in Sweden; and such links would often be very
useful, since the countries have so many cultural ties.
<p>
<img src="f-uk.gif" alt="[Flag of UK]" align=right>
As an important special case, consider the flag which is probably
the most commonly used as a symbol of language.
The
British <a href="http://www.flaginst.demon.co.uk/fiunionflag.htm">Union Flag</a>
(often called Union Jack)
is often used to denote the English language, and sometimes
even called "the English flag". First, it needs to be noted that it
is <em>not</em> the flag of England but of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There <em>is</em> a 
<a href="http://www.flags.net/ENGL.htm"
title="World Flag Database: England"
>flag of
England</a>, but few people outside the United Kingdom know it,
except perhaps as a football team symbol.
More importantly, the majority of people who know English&nbsp;-
or even the majority
of people who speak English as their native language&nbsp;- do not live  in
the United Kingdom.
People who put the Union Flag into their documents to symbolize English
rarely think about this, and neither do they think whether their document
is actually in <em>British</em> English instead of e.g.
American (US) English.
<p>
In many countries, the Union Flag refers to previous colonial masters.
Thus, a flag used as a language symbol may have
unwanted <em>connotations</em>
(in addition to being misleading as
regards to its denotation).
Even if the associated feelings are positive, there is no reason to
raise them, when the communicative purpose is just to refer to
some information written in the English language.</p>

<div>The <a href="http://www.cenorm.be"
title="European committee for standardization"
>CEN</a> Workshop Agreement 
<cite>European Culturally Specific ICT Requirements</cite>
says:</div>
<blockquote><p>The use of national flags to denote language, although convenient to implement, is another potential source of major irritation to the users, particularly for native speakers of the language outside the thus
indicated country.</p></blockquote>

type="application/pdf"><abbr title="CEN Workshop Agreement">CWA</abbr> 14094</a>, clause 5.9</div>

<p>On <strong>international and multilingual pages</strong>,
flags in menus cause great confusion: they would logically denote
countries (leading to country-specific information, in some language)
and they often do, but probably more often they refer
to languages (typically leading to the same information in different
languages).</p>

<h2>Secondary arguments</h2>

<p>An image, even a small one, takes more time to transfer over network
than the alternatives discussed below. This means that the flag images
might appear on the screen only after the text of the document is there.
Such behavior looks odd, since it is contrary to the idea of providing
fast and
comfortable access to versions of a document in different languages.
<p>
Very often images of flags are of poor quality as regards to proportions,
colors, and form.
A flag image of reasonable quality might require a large image file,
making the above-mentioned performance problem more serious.
Images of flags might even be deliberately distorted to achieve
a "cool" effect, such as presenting a rectangular flag as a round button.
A flag of any country should be treated with <strong>respect</strong>;
insulting a flag insults the country and its people.
<p>
An image serves a communicative purpose only if the user can see the image.
There are several reasons why this might fail.
In Web documents, an image can (and should) be accompanied with an
alternative textual presentation
of the same information,
the so-called ALT attribute of an IMG element. For languages,
this is easy, but then you can in fact ask what you need the image for
in the first place.
<p>

<h2>So what symbols should we use for languages?</h2>

<p>There <em>is</em> a perfect symbol for any language which you can use on
the Web: the name of the language in the language itself, e.g.
English (or British English or US English, if needed),
svenska, suomi, Deutsch, français.  (Be careful with the grammatically correct use of
upper and lower case here!)
If a reader doesn't know the name of language <var>X</var>
in <var>X</var>, he
probably does not know <var>X</var> enough for the link to be of use to him.
<p>
If you need something shorter (you don't actually need on the Web,
but you might need when designing e.g. id cards for employees),
you can use the codes defined in the international standard ISO&nbsp;639,
either the
two-letter codes of ISO&nbsp;639-1,
such as <strong>en</strong> for English,
or the
three-letter codes of ISO&nbsp;639-2, like
<strong>eng</strong> for English.
Both types of codes are listed on the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">
ISO 639-2 Registration Authority</a> pages.
The three-letter codes might be regarded as more informative
and more understandable to the speakers of the languages.
They are also more suitable if you expect that less common languages, which
may have no two-letter code, will be included into the language
repertoire. However, two-letter codes are so often used on Web pages
and elsewhere that many people are familiar with them.</p>

<p>
<table align="left" border="0" cellpacing="15"><tr><td>
<span style="background:#eee none;color:#f33;font-weight:bold">[en]</span>
</td></tr></table>
Depending on circumstances and preferences, the names or abbreviations
can be presented in varying styles. In
<a href="html-primer.html">HTML</a> such items, being text, can be
embedded into suitable elements which may affect the size, font, color
and other properties of text presentation.
- However, it is unwise to try to control the presentation too much.
For example, on some
Web pages of the
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/index-en.htm">European Union</a>
(such as <a href=
"http://web.archive.org/web/20031002070138/http://europa.eu.int/geninfo/query_en.htm"
>an old version of the basic search page</a>)
languages have been symbolized correctly by using ISO 639 codes but so that
the letters are
presented as colored images. This raised the irritating
question whether the use of <em>different colors for different languages</em>
carries a message&nbsp;- intentionally or unintentionally.
<p>
In many cases, there is no need to use <em>any</em> symbol for a language.
If you have a link
with anchor text in English (like
<cite>Flag as a symbol of language - stupidity or insult?</cite>),
isn't it pretty obvious that it refers to a document written in English?
And if you have the home page of a company or an association in
several languages, isn't it pretty natural to list its names in those
languages, making each name a link to a version of the document
in that language?</p>
