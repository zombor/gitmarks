    <h1>The Apache 2 ITK MPM</h1>

    <p>apache2-mpm-itk (just mpm-itk for short) is an MPM (Multi-Processing
      Module) for the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> web
      server. mpm-itk allows you to run each of your vhost under a separate uid
      and gid &mdash; in short, the scripts and configuration files for one vhost no
      longer have to be readable for all the other vhosts.</p>
      
    <p>There are already MPMs available that do this; however, I am not aware
      of any besides mpm-itk that are actively developed. (If you only run CGI
      scripts, suexec will probably solve most of your problems with any
      MPM.)</p>

    <p>mpm-itk is based on the traditional <em>prefork</em> MPM, which means
      it's non-threaded; in short, this means you can run non-thread-aware code
      (like many <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> extensions) without
      problems. On the other hand, you lose out to any performance benefit
      you'd get with threads, of course; you'd have to decide for yourself if
      that's worth it or not. You will also take an additional performance
      hit over prefork, since there's an extra fork per request.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>The latest version is <strong>2.2.11-02</strong>, updated <strong>2009-04-14</strong>.
      You can download the
      <a href="apache2.2-mpm-itk-2.2.11-02/">patch series</a> (apply in order), or
      <a href="apache2.2-mpm-itk-20090414-00.patch">monolithic diff</a>.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>If you can't apply a patch, you probably should not be using this. :-)
      However, several distributions now include mpm-itk as a choice alongside
      the other MPMs; in alphabetical order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> ports</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></li>
    </ul>
     
    <p>If you know of any I missed, or if you have included mpm-itk in your
      favourite distribution, please drop me a note (see below).
      I'd always be happy to expand this list :-)</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>The new configuration settings compared to the prefork MPM are:</p>

    <ul> 
      <li><code>AssignUserID</code>: Takes two parameters, uid and gid (or
        really, user name and group name); specifies what uid and gid the
        vhost will run as (after parsing the request etc., of course).
        Note that if you do not assign a user ID, the default one from
        Apache will be used.</li>
      <li><code>MaxClientsVHost</code>: A separate MaxClients
        for the vhost.
        This can be useful if, say, half of your vhosts depend on some NFS
        server (like on our setup); if the NFS server goes down, you do not
        want the children waiting forever on NFS to take the non-NFS-dependent
        hosts down. This can thus act as a safety measure, giving "server too
        busy" on the NFS-dependent vhosts while keeping the other ones
        happily running. (Of course, you could use it to simply keep one site
        from eating way too much resources, but there are probably better
        ways of doing that.)</li>
      <li><code>NiceValue</code>: Lets you nice some requests down, to give
        them less CPU time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AssignUserID and NiceValue can be set wherever you'd like in the Apache
      configuration, except in .htaccess. MaxClientsVHost can only be set
      inside a VirtualHost directive.</p>

    <h2>Quirks and warnings</h2>

    <p>Since mpm-itk has to be able to setuid(),
      it <em>runs as root</em> (although restricted with POSIX capabilities
      where possible) until the request is parsed and the vhost
      determined. This means that <em>any security hole before the request
      is parsed</em> will be a root security hole. (The most likely place
      is probably in mod_ssl.) This is not going to change in the near future,
      as the most likely alternative solution (socket passing and its variants) is very
      hard to get to work properly in a number of common use cases, like
      SSL.</p>

    <p>The lack of socket passing also leads to another minor quirk:
      if you connect to httpd, make a request and then make a request on the
      same connection that gets handled by a different uid, mpm-itk simply
      shuts down the connection. This is perfectly legal according to RFC2616, and
      all major clients seem to handle it well; the web server simply simulates a
      timeout, and the client just opens a new connection and retries the request.
      However, there is a small performance hit, and thus you should avoid including
      content from multiple uids in the same page.</p>

    <p>Note that mpm-itk is experimental software; and we've done a
      fair amount of stress testing, but it's nowhere as tested as, say,
      prefork. That being said, it's being run in production at several
      sites in the world, both hobbyist and commercial, some as large as
      ~10 million hits a day.</p>

    <p>People have reported issues with mpm-itk and mod_python, mod_ruby
      and FastCGI. I believe the mod_python and FastCGI problems have been
      largely solved by updates to those packages, but as I use neither, I
      can't really guarantee anything. YMMV, test before use.</p>
